# Executive Summary: Best-Fit Coaching Philosophies for This Athlete

## Top philosophies recommended for Chris Dick (34-year-old finance professional based in Sevenoaks, UK)

This section reflects Chris Dick’s training context as a 34-year-old finance professional from Sevenoaks preparing for a hilly Ironman.

### 1. Pyramidal “Aerobic Durability” Approach (High-Volume Base, Moderate Intensity)
* **Overview:** Builds fatigue resistance and aerobic base through extensive low-intensity training with regular tempo/threshold efforts over ~17 weeks.[\[1\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=ADVERTISEMENT)[\[2\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873141/#:~:text=,triathletes%20in%20the%20three%20segments)
* **Benefits:**
  * Strengthens muscular and aerobic hill endurance plus run-off-the-bike resilience via a high volume of easy miles.[\[2\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873141/#:~:text=,triathletes%20in%20the%20three%20segments)
  * Lowers injury risk and keeps race-execution transfer high because sessions mirror Ironman pacing and limit excessive intensity.[\[2\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873141/#:~:text=,triathletes%20in%20the%20three%20segments)
* **Drawbacks:** Requires 10–16+ hour weeks; progress is gradual and depends on consistent training volume.[\[2\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873141/#:~:text=,triathletes%20in%20the%20three%20segments)
* **Why it fits:** The athlete’s durability and available time align with this philosophy’s emphasis on volume to conquer hilly Ironman terrain.[\[2\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873141/#:~:text=,triathletes%20in%20the%20three%20segments)

### 2. “Norwegian Method Lite” (Threshold-Focused, Data-Driven)
* **Overview:** Adapts the Blummenfelt/Iden Norwegian model to amateur scale, focusing on precise work between aerobic and anaerobic threshold with lactate or HR guidance.[\[3\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=The%20training%20methods%20we%E2%80%99ll%20discuss,to%20avoid%20injury%20and%20burnout)[\[4\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Clearly%2C%20the%20Norwegian%20Method%20is,professional%20support%20systems%20behind%20them)[\[5\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20easy%2C%20medium%2C%20and%20hard,LT2%29%E2%80%9D)[\[6\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Image%3A%20Norwegian%20Method%20Zones)
* **Benefits:**
  * Raises threshold power for climbs while embedding disciplined pacing control through data-driven intensity limits.[\[6\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Image%3A%20Norwegian%20Method%20Zones)[\[7\]](https://www.tri247.com/race-day-tips/half-ironman-middle-distance-triathlon-pacing-hills-fuelling-race-day-tips#:~:text=On%20the%20climbs%2C%20try%20to,have%20a%20few%20pennies%20left)
  * Includes carefully monitored high-intensity work while protecting recovery windows.[\[6\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Image%3A%20Norwegian%20Method%20Zones)
* **Drawbacks:** Demands strict intensity discipline and can feel mentally tedious; volume must stay near ~10–14 hours/week to avoid burnout rather than the 30+ hours pros do.[\[4\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Clearly%2C%20the%20Norwegian%20Method%20is,professional%20support%20systems%20behind%20them)[\[8\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=High,as%20high%20as%20you%20think)
* **Why it fits:** The athlete’s analytical mindset and durability can leverage threshold volume to sharpen hilly bike pacing and fatigue resistance.[\[6\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Image%3A%20Norwegian%20Method%20Zones)[\[7\]](https://www.tri247.com/race-day-tips/half-ironman-middle-distance-triathlon-pacing-hills-fuelling-race-day-tips#:~:text=On%20the%20climbs%2C%20try%20to,have%20a%20few%20pennies%20left)

### 3. Reverse Periodization & Strength (Sutton/“Trisutto” Method)
* **Overview:** Front-loads intensity, adds volume later, and emphasizes low-cadence hill work, paddles in the swim, and brick runs to build strength early in the season.[\[9\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,volume%20closer%20to%20race%20season)[\[10\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,the%20bike%2C%20hilly%20running%20etc)
* **Benefits:** Early FTP and climbing power gains along with muscular toughness from big-gear cycling and shorter brick simulations of bike-run fatigue make it well suited to hilly Ironman courses.[\[11\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,volume%20closer%20to%20race%20season)
* **Drawbacks:** Carries risk of peaking too soon or muscular overuse if intensity is unchecked, so athletes must cap efforts around 90–95% to avoid injury and monitor recovery closely.[\[12\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,as%20it%20keeps%20your%20form)[\[13\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,time%20as%20has%20achieved%20results)[\[14\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=How%20could%20you%20possibly%20advocate,work%20without%20a%20base)
* **Why it fits:** Matches Chris Dick’s tolerance for structured intensity (34-year-old finance professional based in Sevenoaks, UK), provided he stays disciplined or works with a coach who can keep the volume/intensity balance in check.[\[14\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=How%20could%20you%20possibly%20advocate,work%20without%20a%20base)

*Other philosophies (e.g. pure 80/20 polarized, HIIT-heavy plans, or strict low-HR Maffetone work) are less optimal on their own for this scenario because they either skip hill-specific strength or underuse the athlete’s available training time. Elements from those approaches can still be blended deliberately, but the athlete should pick one primary philosophy (or a well-defined hybrid) and follow its rules consistently.*

## Taxonomy of Ironman Coaching Philosophies

Below is a breakdown of major Ironman training philosophies, each summarized by its core beliefs, priorities, and what it deliberately avoids:

* **Traditional High-Volume Base (Lydiard/Maffetone Model)**  
  – *What it believes:* Endurance performance stems from a massive aerobic base. Athletes must log extensive easy mileage to build capillary density, fat-burning capacity, and durability before adding any fast work[\[15\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=If%20we%20look%20at%20the,between%206%20to%209%20weeks)[\[16\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=Firstly%2C%20after%20the%20long%20base,the%20core%20of%20our%20sport). “Miles make champions,” and a season should start with months of Zone 1–2 training (often low heart-rate per Maffetone).  
  – *What it prioritizes:* Volume, frequency, and consistency at low intensity. Long rides and runs every week; double-session days for volume accumulation. Gradual build in training load over many weeks. Some technique/skills work (swim drills, efficient form) in base phase. Intensity is added only in later build – e.g. marathon-pace/threshold efforts in final 6–8 weeks once base is established. Recovery weeks every 3–4 weeks to consolidate.  
  – *What it avoids:* Early-season speed or hard intervals (seen as injury risk before base is set)[\[16\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=Firstly%2C%20after%20the%20long%20base,the%20core%20of%20our%20sport)[\[14\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=How%20could%20you%20possibly%20advocate,work%20without%20a%20base). Avoids “quality over quantity” early on – no shortcutting the base with high intensity. Minimizes training above lactate threshold except in the final sharpening phase. *In base phase, even moderate “grey-zone” tempo is largely avoided* – intensity stays well below LT1 (aerobic threshold) to maximize fat adaptation.

* **Reverse Periodization (Sutton/Trisutto Model)**  
  – *What it believes:* The conventional “base then intensity” approach is outdated for triathlon[\[17\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/reverse-periodisation-and-the-new-way-forward#:~:text=models%2C%20though%20the%20scientific%20basis,%E2%80%99%20You%20don%E2%80%99t)[\[18\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/reverse-periodisation-and-the-new-way-forward#:~:text=convention,a%20month%20over%20six%20months). Instead, build speed and strength first, even in winter, then add aerobic volume later as races approach. Triathlon is highly aerobic, so one must “keep the aerobic cup full” year-round, but **fast work need not wait**[\[19\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=We%20begin%20our%20year%20as,Many%20have%20asked%20me)[\[20\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=race%20lasts%201%20hour,overdoing%20speed%20work%20is%20negligent). Early-season intensity also maintains athlete engagement and leverages indoor training when weather is poor[\[11\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,volume%20closer%20to%20race%20season)[\[12\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,as%20it%20keeps%20your%20form).  
  – *What it prioritizes:* Key systems trained year-round in parallel[\[21\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=We%20begin%20our%20year%20as,Many%20have%20asked%20me), with an initial bias toward intensity *with ample recovery*. Short, hard repeats (e.g. 25m fast swim, 1’ bike intervals, 50m run strides) at \~90% effort in offseason to build neuromuscular speed without injury[\[22\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/reverse-periodisation-and-the-new-way-forward#:~:text=wisdom%20has%20indicated%20using%20your,As%20far%20back)[\[23\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/reverse-periodisation-and-the-new-way-forward#:~:text=it%E2%80%99s%20short%20and%20sharp,keep%20it%20short%20and%20keep). Lots of strength-oriented work: pull-buoy and paddles swimming, low-cadence “big gear” riding (60–70 RPM)[\[10\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,the%20bike%2C%20hilly%20running%20etc)[\[24\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,as%20it%20keeps%20your%20form), hill runs (often steep, power hiking or hilly fartleks). As race nears, *increase* overall volume and shift more sessions to aerobic endurance focus[\[25\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=discipline,Many%20have%20asked%20me)[\[20\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=race%20lasts%201%20hour,overdoing%20speed%20work%20is%20negligent) – e.g. long brick sessions, race-pace efforts, big gear continued but with longer duration. Reverse plans often peak with the highest weekly hours in the last 2–4 weeks before taper[\[20\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=race%20lasts%201%20hour,overdoing%20speed%20work%20is%20negligent)[\[26\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=running%20which%20is%20good%20to,reduce%20injury%20risk). Recovery days/weeks are inserted *as needed* (coach’s discretion) rather than fixed rotations[\[27\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=We%20now%20know%20it%20does,when%20the%20coach%20sees%20fit)[\[26\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=running%20which%20is%20good%20to,reduce%20injury%20risk).  
  – *What it avoids:* The “junk miles in winter” dogma – no slogging long hours in cold rain just to log base[\[28\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/reverse-periodisation-and-the-new-way-forward#:~:text=or%20Sprint%20distance%20athletes%2C%20or,ranked%20Swim%20Club%20in%20Australia)[\[29\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/reverse-periodisation-and-the-new-way-forward#:~:text=it%20worse%20is%20that%20swimming,a%20month%20over%20six%20months). Avoids all-out sprints – intensity is high but controlled (90–95% max) to prevent injury[\[14\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=How%20could%20you%20possibly%20advocate,work%20without%20a%20base). Does not strictly periodize blocks for each energy system; instead mixes training types weekly (concurrently trains swim, bike, run fitness vs. focusing one discipline per block). Ignores complex periodization for age-groupers with many races; instead trains to handle frequent racing (e.g. multiple Ironmans a season) by staying fit year-round[\[29\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/reverse-periodisation-and-the-new-way-forward#:~:text=it%20worse%20is%20that%20swimming,a%20month%20over%20six%20months).

* **“Polarized” 80/20 Approach (Seiler Model)**  
  – *What it believes:* Endurance athletes achieve best results by doing the majority of training *very easy* and a small portion *very hard*, with little in between[\[30\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,zones)[\[31\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=Zone%203%20is%20above%20second,been%20on%20cross%20country%20skiiers). This “polarized” intensity distribution – \~80% low intensity (Zone1) and \~20% high (Zone3) – is observed in many elite sports (XC skiing, rowing) and maximizes VO₂max and aerobic development while minimizing burnout[\[31\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=Zone%203%20is%20above%20second,been%20on%20cross%20country%20skiiers)[\[32\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=yield%20results.%20,is%20quite%20different%20to%20triathlon). Quality comes from a few hard interval sessions; everything else should be genuinely easy.  
  – *What it prioritizes:* Intensity *segregation*. Easy means easy: lots of Zone1 recovery rides, conversational runs, drills – below first lactate/ventilatory threshold (LT1)[\[33\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,zones). Hard means hard: weekly VO₂max intervals (e.g. 4×4’ at \>90% HRmax) or race-pace efforts above threshold. *Volume is still important* – total hours are ideally high to allow 80% to be truly easy miles[\[34\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=country%20skiiers). Polarized plans often include 2–3 high-intensity sessions per week across disciplines, and all other sessions firmly in Zone1 (or low Zone2 power). Adherence to 80/20 can be measured by time or sessions, but generally for triathlon it’s better tracked by time[\[35\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=Once%20you%20go%20over%20LT2,terms%20of%20VO2%20max%20development)[\[36\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,in%20each%20of%20the%20disciplines). The athlete monitors themselves to avoid the “moderate-intensity rut.” Recovery weeks used as needed if intense sessions accumulate too much fatigue.  
  – *What it avoids:* The mid-zone “grey area” (Zone2 tempo / sweet spot). Polarized coaches deliberately limit time at \~LT1–LT2 range, arguing it yields too much fatigue for too little gain[\[37\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=amount%20of%20high)[\[38\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=For%20triathlon%20you%20might%20want,a%20more%20moderate%20approach%3A%2080%2F13%2F7). Also avoids too many hard days – typically no more than 2 *really hard* workouts in a row, often alternating hard and easy days. *For time-crunched athletes, strict 80/20 can be impractical* (hard to fit 80% easy if total hours are low[\[39\]\[40\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,without%20doing%20VO2%20max%20work)), so pure polarization may not suit those under \~8 hours/week unless modified. Additionally, polarized plans eschew a focus on race-specific sustained tempo – which can be a downside for Ironman (since the race itself is largely moderate intensity).

* **Pyramidal “Balanced” Intensity Distribution**  
  – *What it believes:* A balanced mix of intensities – lots of easy training, **some** moderate (threshold/tempo), and a bit of high – is optimal for long-course triathlon[\[1\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=ADVERTISEMENT)[\[6\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Image%3A%20Norwegian%20Method%20Zones). This is called “pyramidal” because training volume is highest at low intensity and tapers as intensity rises (a pyramid shape)[\[41\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=In%20contrast%2C%20a%20pyramidal%20training,intensity%20training). Research on Ironman athletes suggests a pyramidal approach (e.g. \~75% low, 20% mid, 5% high) correlates with better performance, especially for recreational athletes[\[42\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873141/#:~:text=,triathletes%20in%20the%20three%20segments)[\[43\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873141/#:~:text=,Ironman%20race%20in%20recreational%20triathletes). It retains the aerobic benefits of volume while also “pushing threshold from below” by including regular Zone2/3 work[\[44\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,is%20that%20it%20is%20pyramidal)[\[45\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=It%27s%20about%20building%20the%20base,work%20slightly%20above%20threshold%20regularly).  
  – *What it prioritizes:* Extensive Zone1 mileage *plus* weekly tempo/threshold efforts. A typical week might have 1 tempo run (e.g. 40–60 min at marathon pace), 1 threshold bike interval session (say 3×10’ at 95% FTP), and everything else easy/moderate. Intensity distribution often ends up \~80/15/5 (low/mod/high)[\[46\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=sports%20of%20a%20shorter%20duration%2C,is%20quite%20different%20to%20triathlon)[\[47\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=time%20at%20a%20higher%20intensity,is%20likely%20to%20be%20beneficial). Importantly, *race-pace training is a staple*: for Ironman, that means long bricks or long intervals at goal IM power/pace, which fall in upper Zone2/lower Zone3. This builds confidence and muscular endurance specific to Ironman[\[48\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=James)[\[49\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=With%20triathlon%2C%20you%20can%27t%20hide,a%20decent%20amount%20of%20volume). Pyramidal plans also emphasize overall volume (though not as extremely as pure LSD) – allowing slightly less volume than traditional approach but more intensity to compensate. Consistency over years is key: coaches like Dan Lorang (Frodeno’s coach) stress that accumulating many weeks of mostly low-intensity training “is the primary influencer,” with intensity sprinkled in appropriately[\[50\]](https://mastersoftri.com/low-intensity-training-is-the-primary-influencer/#:~:text=,process%20laid%20out%20by%20Dan).  
  – *What it avoids:* Extremes of *both* kinds – avoids too much high-intensity (so the athlete isn’t constantly sore/fatigued) and also avoids exclusively slow training that neglects race-pace work. In other words, it doesn’t “live” at either pole of polarized or pure base. Specifically avoids the polarizing dogma of keeping *all* tempo out; instead it embraces Zone2/3 work as necessary for Ironman prep[\[42\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873141/#:~:text=,triathletes%20in%20the%20three%20segments)[\[43\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873141/#:~:text=,Ironman%20race%20in%20recreational%20triathletes). However, it also avoids doing every session medium-hard (no “all tempo all the time” – recovery sessions remain easy). Essentially, pyramidal coaches try to hit all energy systems in proportion, with moderate work being an important middle piece, not a forbidden zone.

* **Threshold-Centric (Norwegian / “Double-Threshold” Model)**  
  – *What it believes:* **Lactate threshold is the lynchpin of endurance performance** – by training at or just below LT2, athletes can greatly increase their sustainable speed/power without excessive stress[\[6\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Image%3A%20Norwegian%20Method%20Zones)[\[5\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20easy%2C%20medium%2C%20and%20hard,LT2%29%E2%80%9D). The Norwegian formula (pioneered in running and adopted in triathlon by Blummenfelt & Iden’s team) is heavy on controlled threshold work and meticulous intensity management via lactate or metrics[\[8\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=High,as%20high%20as%20you%20think)[\[5\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20easy%2C%20medium%2C%20and%20hard,LT2%29%E2%80%9D). *Rationale:* Work between LT1 and LT2 (roughly 80–90% of HRmax) allows accumulating a large volume of relatively intense work that boosts aerobic capacity, yet because it stays below true anaerobic intensity, recovery cost is manageable[\[5\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20easy%2C%20medium%2C%20and%20hard,LT2%29%E2%80%9D)[\[6\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Image%3A%20Norwegian%20Method%20Zones). This model asserts you can do far more “intense” training if you prevent going too hard and building excess lactate[\[51\]\[52\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,are%20actually%20training%20at%20threshold).  
  – *What it prioritizes:* **Precision and volume of threshold**. Athletes often do two threshold sessions in one day (“double threshold”) one or two times per week[\[53\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=High,infamous%20aspect%20of%20the%20Norwegian) – for example, 5×6 min run @ LT2 in the morning, 4×10 min bike @ LT2 in evening. Intensity is monitored by blood lactate readings or strict power/HR targets to ensure it’s high Zone3 but not creeping into Zone4 (for Norwegians, \~3–4 mM lactate target in intervals)[\[5\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20easy%2C%20medium%2C%20and%20hard,LT2%29%E2%80%9D)[\[54\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=LT1%20%28,again%2C%20these%20numbers%20can%20vary). Aside from these hard days, the rest is *very low intensity (Zone1)* – Norwegian plans are actually high-volume pyramidal in distribution (e.g. ≈85% easy, 10% threshold, 5% VO₂max)[\[1\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=ADVERTISEMENT)[\[6\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Image%3A%20Norwegian%20Method%20Zones). **High-volume is a pillar** – the method assumes the athlete can handle \~15–30 hours/week, so that even with 10% at threshold, that’s a large absolute amount of intensity[\[8\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=High,as%20high%20as%20you%20think)[\[1\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=ADVERTISEMENT). The motto is “controlled intensity, high consistency.” Every session has a specific purpose; recovery is planned to permit frequent hard workouts. Constant testing/monitoring (lactate, GPS, etc.) to fine-tune zones is also emphasized[\[55\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=intensity%20might%20not%20be%20as,at%20precisely%20the%20correct%20intensity)[\[56\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Method%20is%20the%20constant%20finger,at%20precisely%20the%20correct%20intensity).  
  – *What it avoids:* **Going above threshold** except on rare occasions. The idea is to *never* inadvertently do an anaerobic workout when it’s supposed to be threshold – hence all the measuring[\[57\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=At%20the%20end%20of%20a,are%20actually%20training%20at%20threshold)[\[58\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,are%20actually%20training%20at%20threshold). “No room for being a workout hero” – surges, spikes, hammering up hills are strictly avoided in training[\[59\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Examples%3A)[\[60\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=The%20same%20principles%20apply%20to,free%20environment). Easy days are truly easy (below LT1 \~2 mM lactate, often \<78–80% HRmax)[\[61\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=on%20heart%20rate%20,and%20how%20it%20is%20measured)[\[62\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=The%20Norwegian%20Method%20Lite%20follows,RPE%20for%20strict%20intensity%20discipline). Also avoids large training variety: sessions can be monotonous (e.g. many days of similar threshold intervals, lots of steady Zone1) – enjoyment is sacrificed for efficacy[\[63\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=The%20high,best%20endurance%20athletes%20in%20history). Finally, it avoids the traditional periodization of distinct base/build phases; intensity (threshold) is present year-round, just scaled by total volume. Pure Norwegian model also assumes unlimited recovery time – something amateurs lack, so the full method (with 30+ hour weeks and constant testing) is generally avoided for age-groupers[\[4\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Clearly%2C%20the%20Norwegian%20Method%20is,professional%20support%20systems%20behind%20them) (amateur adaptations discussed later).

* **Sweet Spot / Time-Crunched Approach**  
  – *What it believes:* When training hours are limited, spend more time at moderately high intensity (just below threshold) to maximize training effect per hour[\[64\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,sweet%20spot%20as%20the%20base)[\[65\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,and%20it%20does%20elicit%20results). This is often called “sweet spot” training (around 85–95% of FTP on bike, or steady tempo runs). It yields substantial aerobic gains and muscular endurance with less time than pure base training. Essentially, it’s a pragmatic compromise: if you can’t do 15 hours of easy riding, do 6–8 hours with a lot at sweet spot and you’ll get fitter quickly[\[65\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,and%20it%20does%20elicit%20results)[\[66\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,the%20end%20of%20a%20session). Popularized by some cycling coaches and platforms like TrainerRoad.  
  – *What it prioritizes:* **Efficiency.** Sweet spot sessions appear in most rides – e.g. 2×20’ at 90% FTP, or long tempo bricks. Intensity distribution skews toward Zone2/3 (tempo), with relatively little pure Zone1 (because there’s not enough time to do a lot of Zone1)[\[65\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,and%20it%20does%20elicit%20results)[\[67\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,the%20end%20of%20a%20session). Some high-intensity (VO₂ max) is included but less frequently, since sweet spot itself provides a strong stimulus. Weekly structure might be 3–4 bikes all with substantial tempo portions, 2–3 runs with some tempo, etc. Recovery is carefully managed as the sessions carry more fatigue – often alternate days on/off or use two harder weeks then one lighter. Emphasis on monitoring *training stress* (TSS, etc.) to avoid overdoing it, since sweet spot can accumulate fatigue sneakily. The approach also often uses metrics like FTP tests to calibrate and track progress (and may slightly overestimate FTP from short tests, so good coaches adjust targets down \~5%[\[68\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,an%20overestimation%20of%20the%20FTP)).  
  – *What it avoids:* Long slow sessions beyond what’s necessary. Pure Zone1 rides are minimized – perhaps a short recovery spin, but rarely multi-hour easy rides. Also avoids excessive Zone4–5 work; instead of classic interval sessions at 110% FTP (which require lots of recovery), a sweet spot approach would rather do 90% FTP for longer – seen as more bang-for-buck in time-crunched scenarios[\[66\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,the%20end%20of%20a%20session). It shuns the polarized idea of keeping hard and easy separate; here *most* sessions are somewhat hard. While effective short-term, it can compromise development of fat oxidation (since training is often above the fatmax intensity)[\[69\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=It%20builds%20good%20glycogen%20adaptation,power%2C%20and%20I%20get%20my)[\[70\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,do%20sweet%20spot%20training%20alone). Coaches caution not to rely on sweet spot exclusively year after year due to plateau risk[\[69\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=It%20builds%20good%20glycogen%20adaptation,power%2C%20and%20I%20get%20my). So, it avoids the extremes of volume or intensity, but the trade-off is potential long-term stagnation and less optimal ultra-distance prep (Ironman fueling might suffer if fat adaptation is limited)[\[65\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,and%20it%20does%20elicit%20results)[\[70\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,do%20sweet%20spot%20training%20alone).

* **High-Intensity Interval (HIIT-Heavy) Model**  
  – *What it believes:* You can build endurance by doing lots of short intense intervals, even for Ironman, especially in early training or if the athlete lacks aerobic capacity. This echoes training ideas from Emil Zatopek (who ran huge volumes of intervals) and some modern coaches for time-limited athletes[\[71\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,to%20just%20run%20it%20alone)[\[72\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=It%27s%20important%20to%20keep%20it,compared%20to%20longer%20threshold%20work). Intervals allow one to accumulate more time at a hard pace than one could continuously – e.g. 5×1 km at 5K pace yields more total fast distance than a single 5K run[\[73\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=For%20me%20this%20allows%20greater,often%20do%20it%20too%20fast). For beginners, intervals help build aerobic capacity safely (with rests)[\[74\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=it%20into%20intervals%20you%20could,often%20do%20it%20too%20fast). Essentially, intensity can substitute for some volume – up to a point.  
  – *What it prioritizes:* **Frequency of intense efforts** across swim, bike, run. For example, several interval sessions per week: track repeats, bike VO₂ max workouts, interval-based swim sets. Recovery between reps is seen as key to allow more total quality[\[75\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=to%20if%20you%20were%20to,just%20run%20it%20alone)[\[76\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=This%20does%20negate%20the%20injury,high%20intensity%20all%20at%20once). Often used in *early season blocks* (to boost VO₂max) or for athletes with very limited hours (each session must count). Some plans might schedule interval training almost daily in different forms (e.g. master’s swim with intervals Monday, hard bike Tue, hard run Wed, etc.) but vary intensity domains to avoid monotony. Proper pacing of intervals is emphasized – not going *too* hard on each rep so you can complete the set and not burn out the next day[\[77\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=interval%20training.%20,often%20do%20it%20too%20fast)[\[78\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=However%20if%20you%20do%20too,fresh%20for%20the%20next%20session). HIIT heavy approaches also stress the *neuromuscular benefits* – better form and efficiency at speed, which can translate to improved economy at lower intensities.  
  – *What it avoids:* **Long continuous threshold/tempo efforts** – because if you can achieve the aerobic stimulus with intervals, the philosophy sees less need for grinding long moderate sessions (which can be dull and injury-provoking). It also avoids excessive volume; sessions might be capped at \~60–90 minutes but with plenty of intensity (like a spin class format). Pure HIIT-focused programs try not to do two “hard-hard” days back-to-back without at least short recovery, but some risk of that exists if mis-planned. Another avoidance: **flat pacing** – this model encourages breaking efforts into intervals *specifically* to avoid the strain of non-stop hard efforts that could cause injury or form breakdown[\[79\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=too%20fast). Finally, if used year-round, it avoids the dedicated base phase (contrary to Lydiard); this can lead to burnout if not periodized. Pure HIIT for Ironman is rare, but elements of it are used by athletes like Lionel Sanders at times (he famously did lots of intense trainer rides and runs, though he combined it with huge volume later).

*(Each philosophy has produced champions and failures – the key is matching it to the athlete’s profile and keeping consistent with its rules. Next, we compare how these philosophies stack up for the specific needs of* *Ironman Leeds (hilly)* *and this mid-level amateur.)*

| Philosophy & Coach Exemplar(s) | Core Principles | Strengths for Leeds (Hilly IM) | Weaknesses / Failure Modes | Best-Fit Athlete Profile | Typical Week Structure (mid-season) | Notable Pros Associated |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Traditional High-Volume Base**\<br\>(Lydiard/Maffetone style) | – Big aerobic base first, add intensity later\<br\>– High mileage, low intensity (Z1–2) for weeks/months[\[15\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=If%20we%20look%20at%20the,between%206%20to%209%20weeks)[\[16\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=Firstly%2C%20after%20the%20long%20base,the%20core%20of%20our%20sport)\<br\>– Develop fat-burn, capillaries, “durability” before any hard efforts | **Hill Strength:** Strong aerobic engine handles long climbs at moderate effort; extensive base means less likelihood of blowing up on hills.\<br\>**Run off Bike:** Excellent fatigue resistance – high volume base training improves late-race durability and fuel utilization[\[80\]](https://mastersoftri.com/low-intensity-training-is-the-primary-influencer/#:~:text=,trip%20us%20into%20doing%20more).\<br\>**Low Injury Risk:** Slow build of mileage conditions tendons/muscles gradually. | **Time Demanding:** Requires \~12–20 hr/week of mostly easy training – may overrun available time[\[39\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,without%20doing%20VO2%20max%20work).\<br\>**Slow Feedback:** Performance gains come late; athlete may feel “too slow” during long base (ego check required[\[81\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=He%20looked%20at%20what%20Lydiard,your%20ego%20at%20the%20door)). Risk of boredom or lack of race-specific intensity if base phase too long.\<br\>**Peaking Risk:** If intensity is introduced too abruptly after base, could cause injury (body “not ready” for fast work[\[82\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=to%20incorporate%20faster%20work%20with,with%20the%20traditional%20method%20begin)). Also, pure LSD approach might under-develop top-end needed for steep bursts. | Athletes with ample time, patience, and a history of injuries (benefit from cautious buildup). Typically self-motivated, process-oriented people. Responders: those with moderate to low natural endurance who need aerobic development. Not ideal for very time-crunched athletes or those who need constant variety. | **Base phase:** \~6 days/week. Ex: 4× sessions aerobic bike (incl. 5–6h long ride), 3× aerobic runs (incl. 2–3h long run), 3× swims technique/aerobic. No structured intervals, maybe short strides. \<br\>**Build phase:** 1 tempo run \+ 1 threshold bike per week added, maintain volume. e.g. Tue tempo run, Thu steady long intervals on bike, rest easy. Weekly hours peak then slightly drop as intensity rises. Recovery week every 3–4 weeks cutting volume \~30%. | Mark Allen (6× IMWC wins) – built base via Maffetone HR training[\[80\]](https://mastersoftri.com/low-intensity-training-is-the-primary-influencer/#:~:text=,trip%20us%20into%20doing%20more);\<br\>Dave Scott – high volume & intensity (mixed, but huge base);\<br\>Cam Brown – known for massive mileage in training (longevity). |
| **Reverse Periodization** (Sutton/Trisutto) | – “Intensity first, volume later”[\[22\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/reverse-periodisation-and-the-new-way-forward#:~:text=wisdom%20has%20indicated%20using%20your,As%20far%20back)[\[25\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=discipline,Many%20have%20asked%20me)\<br\>– Early season: high-threshold, VO₂, strength work; Late: big aerobic blocks[\[9\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,volume%20closer%20to%20race%20season)[\[12\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,as%20it%20keeps%20your%20form)\<br\>– Emphasizes strength: low-cadence bike, paddles swim, hill runs[\[10\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,the%20bike%2C%20hilly%20running%20etc) | **Hill Power & Strength:** Early low-cadence climbing and big-gear work builds great muscular strength for Leeds’ hills[\[24\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,as%20it%20keeps%20your%20form). The athlete will find climbing at race-power easier due to those off-season 1min “big gear” repeats.\<br\>**Peak Adaptation:** Piling on volume closer to race specifically trains Ironman aerobic endurance at the right time, without accumulating fatigue too early[\[20\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=race%20lasts%201%20hour,overdoing%20speed%20work%20is%20negligent). This means hitting race day *fresh but fit* aerobically. \<br\>**Mental Variety:** Switching focus mid-season (from intensity to volume) keeps training stimulating. Athletes often feel “fast early” which can boost confidence. | **Pacing/Fatigue Risk:** Getting *very* fit early can tempt an athlete to peak or over-race too soon[\[12\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,as%20it%20keeps%20your%20form). Mental burnout is possible if intensity cycle is too long (hard to maintain \>8–10 weeks of near-threshold training).\<br\>**Run Overload:** Heavy bike strength (60rpm) can leave legs trashed for running if not carefully managed[\[83\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,as%20it%20keeps%20your%20form). Some athletes struggle with running off big-gear training (sore quads)[\[83\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,as%20it%20keeps%20your%20form).\<br\>**Dependence on Coach’s Eye:** The method often uses day-to-day adjustments[\[27\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=We%20now%20know%20it%20does,when%20the%20coach%20sees%20fit) – without a coach, self-coached athletes might miss signs of needed rest, risking injury. Inconsistency or mixing with other methods can break it (e.g. if one fails to add the planned volume later or goes too hard in off-season speed, the balance is lost). | Athletes with a good anaerobic capacity or speed background (e.g. former short-course or swimmers) who need to build endurance later. Those in cold climates (quality indoors in winter, save long rides for summer)[\[11\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,volume%20closer%20to%20race%20season). Responders: mentally tough athletes who trust a plan and enjoy intensity. Less ideal for athletes prone to injury from fast running (though Sutton mitigates with 90% efforts and lower frequency runs[\[14\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=How%20could%20you%20possibly%20advocate,work%20without%20a%20base)[\[84\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/essential-run-advice-coach-brett-sutton/?scope=anon#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20my%20belief%20that%20the,%E2%80%9D)). | **Off-season (Winter):** 5–6 days training, lower hours (\~8–12). E.g. Swim: short repeat sets with paddles/band; Bike: 1–2 turbo sessions (e.g. 20×1’ @ 120% FTP, 1’ rest), some tempo rides \~1–2h, low-cadence drills; Run: hill sprints or fartlek 30–60min, no runs over \~1h. \<br\>**Pre-season (12–8 weeks out):** Volume builds to 14–18h. E.g. include long ride 4–5h (first time), long run \~1.5h. Intensity drops to \~2 high sessions/week (e.g. one threshold swim, one bike VO₂). \<br\>**Final build (last 6 weeks):** Emphasis on long bricks: e.g. 5h hilly bike \+ 40min run off-bike. Still some intensity but more race-pace efforts. E.g. long run includes last 30min at IM goal pace. Last **3 weeks** pre-taper are often the biggest aerobic weeks[\[20\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=race%20lasts%201%20hour,overdoing%20speed%20work%20is%20negligent) (high volume, reduced speed work). | **Daniela Ryf** (5× IMWC) – high-volume final blocks, but until \~8 weeks out often did \<2h rides focusing on power[\[26\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=running%20which%20is%20good%20to,reduce%20injury%20risk); coached by Sutton.\<br\>**Chrissie Wellington** (4× IMWC) – Sutton-coached, known for relentless but controlled training (famously no long run over 2:45).\<br\>**Nicola Spirig** (Olympic gold) – Sutton athlete; even for short-course he used reverse periodization (early speed, later endurance)[\[85\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/reverse-periodisation-and-the-new-way-forward#:~:text=with%20nice%20photos%2C%20there%20is,workouts%20at%20this%20time%20of). |
| **80/20 Polarized** (Seiler/Fitzgerald) | – \~80% low-intensity, \~20% high-intensity[\[31\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=Zone%203%20is%20above%20second,been%20on%20cross%20country%20skiiers) (minimal mid-zone)\<br\>– Develop aerobic base with easy volume; develop speed/VO₂max with intense intervals[\[86\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,is%20quite%20different%20to%20triathlon)[\[39\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,without%20doing%20VO2%20max%20work)\<br\>– Clear hard/easy separation; recovery and consistency are key | **Aerobic Base for Hills:** Plenty of low-intensity volume builds a deep base – helps sustained climbing and recovery between surges. Also, high-intensity intervals increase VO₂max, improving the athlete’s ability to punch over steep sections when needed.\<br\>**Fatigue Predictability:** By avoiding the “grey zone,” the athlete either goes easy or hard. This can make recovery needs clearer – the easy days truly allow recovery, so legs might feel fresher for long climbs after rest days. \<br\>**Execution Under Fatigue:** High-intensity training can improve mental toughness – after doing 5×4’ all-out on the bike, a long hill in Leeds will feel manageable by comparison. It also trains the athlete to handle above-threshold efforts then settle back to lower intensity, a skill useful if some hills push them briefly into the red. | **Limited Specificity:** Ironman race pace is mid-zone (around LT1/LT2 boundary) – polarized plans do *either* much slower or much faster. Athletes might lack practice at sustained IM pace and risk pacing errors or insufficient muscular endurance at that intensity[\[87\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=We%20compete%20for%20a%20longer,without%20doing%20VO2%20max%20work)[\[88\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=For%20longer%20distance%20triathlon%20which,best%20combination%20is%20for%20you). (E.g. doing lots of Zone1 and Zone3, but Ironman bike is Zone2 – which polarized intentionally minimizes[\[37\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=amount%20of%20high).)\<br\>**Time-Starved vs. Volume:** Pure 80/20 works best if you have enough hours to accumulate a big Zone1 volume[\[89\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=It%27s%20worked%20for%20athletes%20who,is%20quite%20different%20to%20triathlon)[\[40\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,without%20doing%20VO2%20max%20work). At 8–12 hr/week, 80% easy \= \~9 hours easy; if one can’t do that, the benefit of polarization diminishes and fitness gains may stall[\[39\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,without%20doing%20VO2%20max%20work). \<br\>**Injury Risk if Misapplied:** Overdoing the 20% hard – e.g. doing HIIT sessions too frequently or too intense – can cause injury/burnout (common if athlete tries to cram more intensity because total hours are low). Also, some athletes inadvertently creep their “easy” days faster (turning 80/20 into 50/50); that breaks the model completely. | Experienced endurance athletes with a sizable base, or anyone who can dedicate high weekly hours (ensuring 80% of a big number is still meaningful training). Good for athletes who enjoy intensity and can recover well. Also suits *those prone to overstretching moderate sessions* – 80/20 gives a clear structure (it forces easy days truly easy). Not ideal for absolute beginners without base (hard intervals might be too taxing) or athletes needing race-pace practice. | **Example week (\~15h):** 3 swims (2 easy aerobic, 1 interval-based with e.g. 20×100m fast); 4 bikes (2 long Z1 rides \~3–4h, 1 VO₂ workout e.g. 5×5’ @ 120% FTP, 1 easy recovery spin); 4 runs (1 long run easy \<Z2, 1 track interval e.g. 6×800m @ 5K pace, 2 short Z1 runs or brick jogs). \<br\>Intensity sessions: usually 2–3 per week in total across sports (e.g. Tues intervals run, Thurs VO₂ bike, Sat maybe a few hard efforts in long ride). Everything else firmly easy (coach may set a HR cap \~75% HRmax for those). \<br\>During Build, might include *some* tempo efforts (some polarized advocates allow a bit of tempo – e.g. 80/15/5 as a “pyramidal tilt” – especially for Ironman[\[47\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=time%20at%20a%20higher%20intensity,is%20likely%20to%20be%20beneficial)). But purest form keeps it minimal. | **Matt Fitzgerald (author)** – promoter of 80/20 tri plans for AGers;\<br\>**Stephen Seiler** (researcher) – studied polarized training in elites[\[31\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=Zone%203%20is%20above%20second,been%20on%20cross%20country%20skiiers);\<br\>**Lucy Gossage** (AG-to-pro) – used polarized approach in some off-seasons (anecdotally).\<br\>*Note:* Few Ironman elites use *strict* 80/20 year-round, but many incorporate its principles in base phases. |
| **Pyramidal (Canova/Lorang style)** | – Mixed intensities: \~70–85% easy, \~10–20% mid (tempo/threshold), \~5% high[\[90\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873141/#:~:text=based%20on%20the%20cumulative%20time,Ironman)[\[42\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873141/#:~:text=,triathletes%20in%20the%20three%20segments)\<br\>– Regular sessions at goal race pace or slightly above (“specific endurance”)[\[91\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=The%20whole%20ideology%20is%20about,potential)[\[92\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,is%20that%20it%20is%20pyramidal)\<br\>– Volume is important but balanced with moderate-hard work to boost threshold | **Specific Hill Preparation:** Regular moderate climbs or tempo rides simulating Leeds course (e.g. 2×20 km at IM pace on hills) build exactly the muscular endurance and pacing skills needed[\[93\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,focus%2C%20but%20not%20always%20speed)[\[49\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=With%20triathlon%2C%20you%20can%27t%20hide,a%20decent%20amount%20of%20volume). Athlete practices riding *just below threshold* on hills, which is key for not “burning matches.”\<br\>**Strong Ironman Run Off Hills:** Including tempo runs (e.g. progression runs or steady Z3 efforts) improves aerobic threshold – preserving more glycogen for the run. The approach also often features “fast finish” long runs or bricks that teach the body to run well on tired legs (highly relevant to hilly-bike to run combo).\<br\>**Flexibility & Robustness:** Because it trains all zones, the athlete develops a broad base – if hills force them above plan, they have some high-end training; if weather or fatigue demands easier effort, they have huge low-end base. Pyramidal is inherently adaptable. | **Higher Training Load:** Doing tempo \+ high volume can be strenuous – risk of overtraining if recovery is insufficient. E.g. long run with sections at marathon pace is quite taxing, so without proper recovery, could accumulate fatigue. It’s somewhat “high volume \+ intensity,” requiring fine-tuning for amateurs to avoid burnout (hence Dan Lorang’s stress on listening to the body[\[80\]](https://mastersoftri.com/low-intensity-training-is-the-primary-influencer/#:~:text=,trip%20us%20into%20doing%20more)[\[94\]](https://mastersoftri.com/low-intensity-training-is-the-primary-influencer/#:~:text=shows%20their%20commitment%20to%20consistency,not%20necessarily)).\<br\>**Complexity:** The athlete must juggle different types of workouts (long slow, tempo, interval) – requires good scheduling and understanding of purpose. A poorly structured pyramidal plan can turn into “do everything, do it hard,” which is not the goal. Consistency can suffer if athlete pushes moderate days too hard (turning them into pseudo-interval days).\<br\>**Mid-Zone Creep:** There’s a mild risk of too much moderate work (since it’s allowed). If the athlete enjoys tempo, they might default to that too often and neglect true recovery or true high-end stimuli. Coaches mitigate this by strictly defining “hard vs. moderate vs. easy” days. | Well-rounded athletes who have a decent base and need to raise their threshold or race pace. Great for Ironman athletes with 10–15 hr/week who want maximum return – it’s evidence-based for half/full IM amateurs[\[42\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873141/#:~:text=,triathletes%20in%20the%20three%20segments)[\[43\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873141/#:~:text=,Ironman%20race%20in%20recreational%20triathletes). Also suits those who mentally like variety. Many elite long-course athletes fall here. If an athlete has moderate time and decent injury resilience, pyramidal often yields the best of both worlds. | **Week (\~14h in Build):** E.g. Mon recovery swim; Tue: bike 90min tempo (e.g. 2×15’ at 85–90% FTP) \+ brick run 20min easy; Wed: medium-long run 75min including last 20 at IM goal pace; Thu: swim threshold set (e.g. 10×200 @ T-pace) \+ easy bike; Fri: rest or easy jog; Sat: long bike 4.5h with IM watts efforts on climbs (normalize power \~70% FTP)[\[95\]](https://www.tri247.com/race-day-tips/half-ironman-middle-distance-triathlon-pacing-hills-fuelling-race-day-tips#:~:text=Stay%20focused%20on%20the%20downhills)[\[96\]](https://www.tri247.com/race-day-tips/half-ironman-middle-distance-triathlon-pacing-hills-fuelling-race-day-tips#:~:text=Use%20the%20downhills%20to%20recover,as%20much%20momentum%20as%20possible) \+ brick run 30min easy; Sun: long run 2h easy. \<br\>Within this, intensity distribution might be \~10% of time at threshold (swim \+ tempo ride), \~10% at IM-pace (in long efforts), rest easy. Over weeks, length of race-pace efforts and tempo intervals would increase as fitness improves (progressive overload). A *race simulation brick* (e.g. 5h ride \+ 1h run both at race effort) appears \~4–5 weeks out. | **Jan Frodeno** (Olympic & IM champ) – Coach Dan Lorang uses a mostly pyramidal approach: “low intensity is primary” but includes tempo/threshold when needed[\[80\]](https://mastersoftri.com/low-intensity-training-is-the-primary-influencer/#:~:text=,trip%20us%20into%20doing%20more)[\[97\]](https://mastersoftri.com/low-intensity-training-is-the-primary-influencer/#:~:text=,process%20laid%20out%20by%20Dan).\<br\>**Anne Haug** (2019 IMWC) – Lorang-coached, built huge base plus threshold blocks.\<br\>**Patrick Nilsson** (Sub-8 IM) – known for big volume and race-pace specificity (pyramidal training reported). |
| **Threshold-Heavy** (“Norwegian” model) | – Large volume at 90–100% of LT2 (“upper tempo / low threshold”)[\[6\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Image%3A%20Norwegian%20Method%20Zones)\<br\>– Double threshold days (morning & evening interval sessions)[\[53\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=High,infamous%20aspect%20of%20the%20Norwegian) for advanced athletes\<br\>– Intensity guided by lactate or precise metrics to avoid crossing into anaerobic[\[5\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20easy%2C%20medium%2C%20and%20hard,LT2%29%E2%80%9D)[\[54\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=LT1%20%28,again%2C%20these%20numbers%20can%20vary) | **Climbing and Power Control:** This method produces a very high lactate threshold – meaning the athlete can sustain a higher power output without redlining[\[5\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20easy%2C%20medium%2C%20and%20hard,LT2%29%E2%80%9D)[\[54\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=LT1%20%28,again%2C%20these%20numbers%20can%20vary). On Leeds hills, they can ride closer to threshold (or run up hills) without accumulating excessive lactate. They become adept at sensing and managing effort – useful for pacing those climbs so they *don’t* destroy the run. \<br\>**Pacing & Fueling Execution:** By training a lot at “just-hard-enough” intensity and measuring response, athletes learn discipline. They won’t surge uncontrollably; they practice even splitting and monitoring how effort affects lactate/HR[\[59\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Examples%3A)[\[60\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=The%20same%20principles%20apply%20to,free%20environment). This makes them *excellent at sticking to race plan*. Threshold sessions also improve carbohydrate efficiency (body gets used to clearing lactate and using carbs at high rate), which if coupled with good fueling can extend how long they sustain near-IM effort. \<br\>**High Performance Upside:** This is essentially how the world’s best are training (albeit at pro volume) – it’s been proven to win championships. For a mid-level athlete who can safely incorporate a scaled version, it offers a taste of *cutting-edge* gains. | **Recovery & Injury Risk:** Threshold work is hard on the body – doing it regularly (even if controlled) plus the needed volume is taxing[\[98\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=It%27s%20important%20to%20keep%20it,compared%20to%20longer%20threshold%20work)[\[99\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=However%20if%20you%20do%20too,fresh%20for%20the%20next%20session). If recovery (sleep, nutrition) falters, athlete can stagnate or get sick/injured. Many age-groupers struggle to recover from even 2 threshold sessions a week while juggling life. Overuse niggles (Achilles, ITB) can creep in if intensity or run volume isn’t modulated.\<br\>**Monotony/Mental Strain:** The training can feel repetitive and “clinical.” E.g. riding indoor trainer at 230W, checking lactate, not allowed to push harder – some athletes find this stifling or boring[\[63\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=The%20high,best%20endurance%20athletes%20in%20history)[\[59\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Examples%3A). It **requires** patience and trust in numbers. If an athlete thrives on spontaneity or variety, they may mentally burn out following this rigid structure.\<br\>**Scaling Down Issues:** The full Norwegian method presumes \~30h/week; at 10h/week, you simply can’t do the same volume of intensity. The amateur must cut volume (fewer intervals) but that reduces its effectiveness somewhat. There’s a risk of trying to compress too much into fewer hours – if the athlete tries to do *the same* double threshold days on only 8h/week total, it’s an extreme intensity fraction that could backfire. Thus, without careful scaling, an AG could overtrain. Also, using lactate testing requires some investment (device, learning) – not all will do that, so intensity control might slip. | Highly data-driven, disciplined athletes – those who enjoy metrics, spreadsheets, seeing lactate numbers. Often works well for athletes coming from a swimming background (used to interval training daily) or those plateaued with lower-intensity approaches and seeking a breakthrough. Needs moderate to high time availability (ideally ≥12 hr/week) to include enough low-intensity support around the threshold work. Also helps if athlete has access to a coach or testing to set proper zones. Not suited for athletes with frequent injuries (intensity load is high) or those who hate structured intervals. | **Proto-typical week (scaled for AG, \~12h):** \<br\>Mon: Easy recovery day (swim 45’ easy drills \+ 30’ Zone1 run). \<br\>Tue: **Double Threshold** – AM: Run 45’ w/ 5×6’ at threshold (say 4 mMol lactate target)[\[100\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Double%20threshold%20days%20As%20simple,at%20precisely%20the%20correct%20intensity); PM: Bike 60’ w/ 4×10’ just below LT2 (power per testing). All other time in these sessions Zone1. \<br\>Wed: Low day – 90’ easy bike (strictly below LT1 \~2 mMol)[\[54\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=LT1%20%28,again%2C%20these%20numbers%20can%20vary); optional light strength or rest. \<br\>Thu: Threshold swim (e.g. 5×400m at threshold pace, with 20” stops to measure lactate or check effort). Afternoon: 40’ easy run with 4×20” strides (a bit neuromuscular work but not anaerobic). \<br\>Fri: **Double Threshold** – AM: Bike VO₂max block (3×3’ at slightly above LT2, though Norwegians might call this “hard threshold” \~92–95% HRmax) – or could be another threshold session depending on phase; PM: Run 40’ with 3×8’ at high-Z3 (slightly harder than Tue’s perhaps). \<br\>Sat: Long bike 4h Zone1/low-Z2 (flat-ish route, *strict* cap at 1.5 mMol if measuring). Include a few short pickups to stay loose but no sustained efforts above LT1. \<br\>Sun: Long run 1.5h mostly easy; if feeling good, finish last 15’ at marathon (IM) pace (around LT1). \<br\>*Note:* Lactate or reliable proxies (HR, RPE) guide all intensity – the athlete often stops mid-interval to ensure lactate is \~3 mMol, not creeping to 5[\[55\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=intensity%20might%20not%20be%20as,at%20precisely%20the%20correct%20intensity)[\[56\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Method%20is%20the%20constant%20finger,at%20precisely%20the%20correct%20intensity). Recovery between intervals is just enough to reset (\~2–3min), not full rest, to accumulate time near threshold. As season progresses, might add a few *supra-threshold* VO₂ sessions (Norwegians do block-periodize some high-intensity closer to races). | **Kristian Blummenfelt** (Olympic & IM Champ) – poster child of Norwegian model: huge volume (\~30h/week) \+ regular lactate-controlled double thresholds[\[8\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=High,as%20high%20as%20you%20think)[\[53\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=High,infamous%20aspect%20of%20the%20Norwegian).\<br\>**Gustav Iden** (2× 70.3 WC, 2022 IMWC) – same program; known for disciplined pacing.\<br\>**Norwegian squad** (Stornes, Løvseth etc.) – all using this approach, dominating debuts[\[101\]](https://run.outsideonline.com/training/norwegian-method-secret/?scope=anon#:~:text=If%20that%20sounds%20familiar%2C%20it%E2%80%99s,World%20Championship%20on%20their%20debuts)[\[102\]](https://run.outsideonline.com/training/norwegian-method-secret/?scope=anon#:~:text=Coincidence%3F%20No%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20the%20Norwegian,in%20the%20way%20you%20think).\<br\>**Lionel Sanders** (top Canadian) – *not originally Norwegian style, but in 2022 he hired coach Mikal Iden and began incorporating lactate testing and threshold blocks, improving consistency.* |

| :---- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Traditional Base** | 2 – requires many hours for gains | 4 – superb base for hills, but lacks high-end if hills require surges | 5 – very low injury risk if done correctly (slow build)[\[103\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/essential-run-advice-coach-brett-sutton/?scope=anon#:~:text=in%20run%20training%20is%20the,%E2%80%9D) | 3 – easy physically (all low-intensity) but patience needed (monotony risk) | 4 – fatigue mostly proportional to volume; low-intensity fatigue is “safer” (but can sneak up if volume ramps too fast) | 3 – good aerobic transfer, but less race-pace practice (needs later sharpening) | 4 – sustainable if athlete enjoys long solo training; boredom can strike others | 4 – lots of low-intensity riding perfect for adapting to aero gradually (no pressure to hammer in new position) |
| **Reverse Periodization** (Trisutto) | 3 – moderate (less volume early, but intensity is tough) | 5 – high upside for hilly courses: early strength \+ later endurance \= well-rounded power endurance | 3 – moderate risk: early intensity can injure if unsupervised, but controlled 90% efforts mitigate it[\[14\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=How%20could%20you%20possibly%20advocate,work%20without%20a%20base). Volume ramp later can risk injury if too sudden. | 2 – demands willingness to suffer in workouts and trust delayed volume. Also day-to-day adjustments (needs flexibility from athlete scheduling)[\[27\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=We%20now%20know%20it%20does,when%20the%20coach%20sees%20fit). Not “easy” mentally. | 2 – harder to predict; athlete may feel *very* tired after big intensity blocks, then suddenly volume adds new fatigue. Coach monitoring often used to adjust recovery on fly. | 4 – quite high: final phase does sport-specific volume (simulations), and early strength work directly benefits hills. Slight gap: run volume might be lower until late (some athletes may feel under-prepared for run distance). | 3 – some find it invigorating (always changing focus), others might mentally crack during intense phases. If balanced, can be long-term sustainable (Sutton had athletes train this way for years). | 3 – early phase is short workouts (good to practice aero in small doses). Later long rides: if position not adapted, risk discomfort. But approach inherently allows focus on position in final block. Athlete must ensure to integrate TT bike early enough despite focus on intensity. |
| **Polarized 80/20** | 4 – quite efficient if volume is sufficient (intervals drive gains) | 3 – decent upside: improves engine, but may underdevelop muscular endurance for continuous hills[\[104\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=We%20compete%20for%20a%20longer,without%20doing%20VO2%20max%20work)[\[105\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=For%20longer%20distance%20triathlon%20which,best%20combination%20is%20for%20you) | 4 – generally low injury (80% easy is protective). Some risk if athlete overdoes the 20%. | 5 – conceptually simple (hard vs. easy); flexible with life schedule. Many find it enjoyable to go hard then truly chill on easy days. | 5 – very predictable: easy days one feels fine, hard days very tired but short-lived. The clear oscillation helps gauge fatigue. | 3 – moderate: low-intensity volume helps aerobic base, high-intensity helps top-end, but lack of tempo means less practice at IM power output. Need to add some race-pace sessions (making it more pyramidal) for best transfer[\[47\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=time%20at%20a%20higher%20intensity,is%20likely%20to%20be%20beneficial). | 4 – high variety (hard efforts) keeps it interesting; easy days give mental breaks. Many age-groupers sustain 80/20 for years. | 3 – easy rides give time in aero, but athlete might do intense rides on road bike or upright (intervals often done on trainer sitting up to breathe). Must ensure some aero interval practice. Overall, fine as long as athlete consciously practices aero position on a chunk of easy miles. |
| **Pyramidal (Balanced)** | 4 – efficient: uses moderate & some high intensity to amplify gains from volume[\[42\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873141/#:~:text=,triathletes%20in%20the%20three%20segments) | 5 – arguably best for Ironman: studies show Zone2 time correlates with better IM performance[\[43\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873141/#:~:text=,Ironman%20race%20in%20recreational%20triathletes). Addresses hills via tempo and overall endurance. | 4 – moderate injury risk: includes tempo/threshold but not excessive. Slightly higher than pure LSD, but lower than HIIT-heavy. With sensible progression, robust[\[43\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873141/#:~:text=,Ironman%20race%20in%20recreational%20triathletes). | 4 – requires planning but not overly rigid. Athletes often enjoy mix of workout types. Not as mentally taxing as constant intervals or as dull as constant slow miles. | 4 – more linear fatigue response. Some weeks with both tempo and long miles can feel heavy, but typically balanced by easier days. Coach/athlete can anticipate needing rest after key overload weeks (e.g. after a race-pace brick). | 5 – very high: frequently trains at or near IM effort, includes bricks and simulation. Athlete hits hills, pace, nutrition practice regularly. Come race day, body recognizes the intensities. | 5 – high sustainability. Mix of hard/easy keeps motivation. Many elites follow this year in, year out. Avoiding extremes prevents mental burnout. Must guard against doing too many “moderate” sessions – but when done right, it’s enjoyable. | 4 – plenty of long rides of varied intensity allows progressive aero adaptation (some sessions focus on aero form). Because plan isn’t all-out intervals, athlete can afford to do them on TT bike. Should still dedicate specific rides to position work, but overall aligns well (e.g. tempo efforts can be done in aero). |
| **Threshold-Heavy (Norwegian Lite)** | 3 – moderately efficient: threshold work gives big gains but also needs lots of easy support miles[\[1\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=ADVERTISEMENT)[\[6\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Image%3A%20Norwegian%20Method%20Zones). So not as time-crunched as sweet spot; it’s more **time-investment \+ high payoff**. | 5 – very high upside if done correctly: raises sustainable power, seen in Norwegians dominating debuts[\[106\]](https://run.outsideonline.com/training/norwegian-method-secret/?scope=anon#:~:text=If%20that%20sounds%20familiar%2C%20it%E2%80%99s,World%20Championship%20on%20their%20debuts)[\[102\]](https://run.outsideonline.com/training/norwegian-method-secret/?scope=anon#:~:text=Coincidence%3F%20No%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20the%20Norwegian,in%20the%20way%20you%20think). Hills that sit at \~FTP become manageable all day. Also high upside for *run* – threshold run sessions improve durability at marathon pace. | 2 – higher injury risk: large volume of near-threshold running can lead to overuse if athlete not conditioned[\[79\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=too%20fast)[\[107\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=This%20does%20negate%20the%20injury,high%20intensity%20all%20at%20once). Also risk of illness/overtraining if recovery neglected (since many sessions are taxing). Needs careful monitoring – not inherently “robust” without that. | 2 – tough compliance: demands strict pacing (no “fun smash-fests”), lots of structure. Also requires significant recovery routines (sleep, nutrition) which might strain lifestyle. Athletes juggling job/family may struggle to hit every planned threshold session fresh. Mentally, it’s rigorous and can feel like a job. | 3 – threshold training can produce lingering fatigue (legs often heavy, monotony fatigue). But because intensity is controlled (not supra-maximal), it might be less acutely exhausting than HIIT – more a constant medium fatigue that must be managed. Athletes must track morning HR, mood, etc. to catch accumulating fatigue. When dialed in, it’s decently predictable – e.g. lactate rising at same power indicates fatigue and triggers an easier day. So with data, can be predictive; without, could sneak into overreach. | 4 – good transfer: many sessions at or slightly above IM intensity (especially the “medium threshold” at LT1/LT2 range)[\[108\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Norwegian%20Method%20Lite%20Key%3A)[\[109\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=,FTP). Pacing discipline directly translates; athlete arrives knowing exactly what effort they can sustain. Slight gap: not much practice above threshold (so if Leeds has very steep spikes, that’s unfamiliar – but ideally athlete will avoid those surges anyway). | 3 – some athletes thrive on routine and respond for years (Norwegian athletes built over decades with it). Others burn out after one season due to the intensity of focus required. For amateurs, doing even a “lite” version might be best in shorter blocks (e.g. a 8–10 week experiment) rather than year-round, to avoid mental fatigue. | 3 – by nature, many threshold workouts are done on trainers or measured environments – great for focusing on aero tweaks (you can lock into position and hit target wattages). However, long easy volume still needed – ensure a lot of that is on TT bike to adapt. The method’s success partly relies on monotony tolerance, so doing indoor rides in aero could actually expedite adaptation (like Blummenfelt often trains indoors to control conditions[\[60\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=The%20same%20principles%20apply%20to,free%20environment)). But risk: position fatigue could alter power output, so must integrate carefully (perhaps do shorter intervals in full aero, sit up if power starts to drop unnaturally). |
| **Sweet Spot / HIIT Hybrid** | 5 – very time-efficient: gets big gains on 6–8 hr/week by packing intensity[\[66\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,the%20end%20of%20a%20session). | 2 – moderate upside for Ironman: can boost FTP and speed quickly, but without long aerobic base, athlete may fade in a 140.6 or struggle on extended climbs due to limited fat-adaptation[\[69\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=It%20builds%20good%20glycogen%20adaptation,power%2C%20and%20I%20get%20my). | 2 – higher risk: lots of moderate-hard efforts with minimal true recovery can accumulate stress. Many athletes report niggles or burnout after long stints of sweet spot focus (needs deloads). Pure HIIT every day is also unsustainable beyond short term – risk of illness/injury spikes after \~3–4 weeks of heavy HIIT. | 3 – physically hard but convenient (short sessions). Some enjoy feeling “smoked” after each session – gives satisfaction. But compliance can drop if every workout is grueling (motivation dips). Also, without a coach, athletes often misjudge intervals and either go too hard (burnout) or too easy (stall progress). | 2 – fatigue can be deceptive; athlete may feel fine then suddenly overtrain. Without low-intensity days, there’s less “active recovery” – it’s mostly work or off. This on/off pattern can make it hard to read early overtraining signs. Often, performance improves for \~6–8 weeks then plateaus or regresses if no change – indicating accumulated fatigue. | 2 – low: doesn’t specifically train going long at steady output. An athlete might see big FTP or 10K improvements, but Ironman is about *all-day economy*. Without long bricks or nutrition practice, execution can suffer (GI issues, pacing mistakes). Some coaches pair sweet spot bike training with occasional long rides to counter this – otherwise, race specificity is lacking (this is why pure TrainerRoad plans sometimes left triathletes biking strong but walking the run). | 2 – short-term exciting (fast gains), but high intensity blocks must be cycled or athletes stagnate and get demoralized. Many can’t sustain year-round HIIT focus – mental fatigue and dread of workouts set in. Sweet spot maybe a bit more sustainable (not full-gas), but constant days at “hard-ish” effort with no real easy days can wear down morale. | 4 – interestingly, a time-crunched plan often means more indoor trainer time: easier to fit TT bike sessions in controlled setting. Sweet spot intervals can be done in aero if position allows (they are not as oxygen-demanding as VO₂max work, so feasible). Many athletes get a new TT bike and follow a TrainerRoad plan – a common scenario. It’s compatible, but *adaptation pain points* (neck, saddle) might be exacerbated if jumping straight into intense aero sessions. Ideally ramp into it: start with sweet spot intervals on road position, gradually lower to aero as comfort increases. |

*Key:* **Time Efficiency:** improvements per hour spent; **Performance Upside:** maximum potential gains for hilly Ironman; **Robustness:** how well the approach avoids injury/burnout; **Ease of Compliance:** how easy to follow given life/mental factors; **Fatigue Predictability:** how straightforward to manage fatigue; **Execution Transfer:** how well training prepares athlete for Ironman pacing/nutrition/terrain; **Mental Sustainability:** can it be maintained season after season; **TT-bike Compatibility:** how easily one can integrate TT position training.

## Deep Dives: Major Ironman Coaching Philosophies in Practice

In this section, we explore **four major coaching philosophies** in depth – how each structures training through base, build, peak, and taper; what key sessions look like in swim/bike/run; how progression is managed; and how plans are adapted from elite to amateur needs. These deep dives will illustrate what a training cycle under each philosophy *feels like* and how consistency is maintained.

### 1\. High-Volume Aerobic Base (Traditional Periodization) – *“Durability First”*

**What It Is:** The classic approach of starting with extensive low-intensity training (the “base phase”), then gradually layering in intensity (build), sharpening for race (peak), and tapering. This method underpinned the training of early Ironman legends and remains foundational in many coaching plans (e.g. Joe Friel’s *Triathlon Training Bible* follows this structure). It’s exemplified by Arthur Lydiard’s model adapted to triathlon: *miles first, speed later*[\[15\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=If%20we%20look%20at%20the,between%206%20to%209%20weeks)[\[16\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=Firstly%2C%20after%20the%20long%20base,the%20core%20of%20our%20sport).

**Base Phase (e.g. Weeks 17–11 out from race):** Goal is to build a “aerobic engine” and structural resilience. For \~6–8 weeks, the athlete focuses on **increasing volume** of swimming, biking, and running at low intensity (Zone1–low Zone2). A sample base week:

* **Swim:** 3 sessions emphasizing technique and steady aerobic pace. e.g. 1 drill-focused swim (with form drills, sculling, etc.), 1 endurance swim (e.g. 3×1000m at comfortable pace), 1 moderate continuous swim or short repeats with ample rest (e.g. 10×100m easy, focusing on form). Intensity is low/moderate – maybe occasional short sprints to keep feel for water, but no hard interval sets yet.

* **Bike:** 3–4 rides. A “long ride” on weekend, starting \~3h and adding \~15–30min each week[\[110\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/essential-run-advice-coach-brett-sutton/?scope=anon#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20essential%20run%20workouts%20age,four%20workouts%20that%20are%20essential)[\[111\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/essential-run-advice-coach-brett-sutton/?scope=anon#:~:text=a,done%20at%20a%20conversational%20pace) (aim to reach \~5–6h by end of base). One or two mid-week steady rides \~60–90km (could be on trainer or outdoors, Zone2 effort). If athlete commutes, those can be extra easy miles. Cadence drills or single-leg drills might be included for neuromuscular training. All rides are mainly aerobic; any intensity comes naturally via terrain (the athlete is instructed *not* to hammer hills – keep in Zone2 cap).

* **Run:** 3–5 runs. Key is the **long run**: start \~1h30 and build to \~2h–2h15 by base phase end. Pace is conversational. One medium run (\~1h) mid-week. Possibly one short brick off a bike (20–30min easy) to start adapting legs to running off rides. No formal speedwork; however, coaches often include **strides**: e.g. 6×20s accelerations at 5K pace at the end of an easy run, to maintain leg speed and improve economy without counting as “intensity.” These strides (or hill strides) are run on a soft flat or slight incline and the athlete keeps them relaxed[\[112\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/essential-run-advice-coach-brett-sutton/?scope=anon#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20most%20beneficial%20run%20I%E2%80%99d,%E2%80%9D).

* **Other:** If doing strength training, base phase is when it’s included 1–2× weekly (focus on core stability, general strength, as there’s less risk of interfering with key sessions because intensity is low). Flexibility and technique (e.g. fixing swim form flaws) are emphasized now.

**Intensity Control:** Often using heart-rate or zone caps to ensure proper intensity discipline. For example, athlete might use the Maffetone formula (HR ≈ 180-age) as a ceiling for runs – ensuring they truly stay aerobic. By end of base, the athlete should notice **improvements in aerobic metrics**: lower HR for the same pace (e.g. 8:00/mi was HR155, now 145), higher power at aerobic threshold, etc. These indicate a successfully built base.

**Build Phase (e.g. Weeks 10–5 out):** Now intensity is introduced to “build” race-specific fitness on top of the base. Volume typically plateaus or even reduces slightly to accommodate intensity. Key changes:

* Add **threshold / tempo workouts**: e.g. one threshold run per week (such as 2×20min at half-marathon pace with 5min easy between, or progression run finishing at near lactate threshold). On the bike, introduce sweet spot/threshold intervals (e.g. 3×12min at 90% FTP, 5min easy between). These improve lactate clearance and sustainable pace – important for hilly courses so the athlete can handle climbs without redlining[\[113\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,a%20decent%20pace%20at%20threshold)[\[81\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=He%20looked%20at%20what%20Lydiard,your%20ego%20at%20the%20door).

* Introduce **brick workouts**: e.g. every 1–2 weeks, do a bike-run brick at race-like effort. Early build bricks might be shorter, e.g. 3h ride (Zone2) \+ 45min run (Zone2). Later (toward peak) these bricks become longer and closer to Ironman effort (more below).

* Keep a **long aerobic day**: Long ride continues (may hit 5–6h range) but some intensity can be inserted. A favorite is the “fast finish” long ride: last 60–90min at IM race pace (Zone2/low3) to simulate fatigued riding. Similarly, long run might include last few miles at goal marathon pace if the base is solid[\[111\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/essential-run-advice-coach-brett-sutton/?scope=anon#:~:text=a,done%20at%20a%20conversational%20pace)[\[114\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/essential-run-advice-coach-brett-sutton/?scope=anon#:~:text=d,time%20to%20help%20with%20performance) (note: in Brett Sutton’s advice, for Ironman the tempo run is only \~25% race distance at race pace[\[115\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/essential-run-advice-coach-brett-sutton/?scope=anon#:~:text=,distance%20for%20the%20Fartlek%20run) – so for a marathon, \~10km at goal pace – a similar principle).

* **Volume**: Typically volume is still high relative to athlete’s capacity but not increasing. Many will maintain \~14–18 hr/week through build. If the athlete struggled with base volume, some plans actually reduce volume 10–20% when adding intervals, to avoid overload. Others keep volume and rely on the base fitness to absorb the new intensity.

**Progression & Key Sessions in Build:** Each week might build intensity by either extending interval length or slightly upping pace. Example key sessions: \- **Bike threshold**: Week1: 3×10’ @ FTP, Week3: 3×15’ @ 95% FTP, Week5: 2×20’ @ 100% FTP. Always with ample recovery (1:1 or 1:0.5 work:rest). \- **Run tempo**: Week1: 20’ @ marathon pace, Week3: 30’ @ marathon, Week5: 2×20’ @ half-marathon pace. \- **Long brick**: Week2: 4h ride \+ 30’ run (both easy/mod). Week4: 5h ride (include 2×20’ at race power) \+ 45’ run (easy). Week6: 5h ride (last 1h at race power) \+ 1h run (build from easy to race pace last 20’). These bricks teach pacing and nutrition – athlete practices fueling exactly as on race day (Leeds being hilly might require fueling on climbs and descents practice, see Leeds module later).

During build, the athlete starts *feeling* faster: e.g. they might do a half-marathon or 100km sportive as low-priority tune-up races, converting base into performance. Traditional plans often include a tune-up race \~6–8 weeks out (like an Olympic or 70.3 tri) to test fitness and practice transitions/pacing.

**Peak Specific Phase (Weeks 4–3 out):** In a strict traditional model, this is short because the athlete should already be near peak. Two or three weeks in which training becomes highly specific to Ironman pace and course demands: \- **Race-pace Brick Rehearsal:** About 4 weeks out, a simulation: e.g. *Bike 6 hours @ goal IM effort on terrain simulating Leeds hills, then run 1 hour @ goal IM pace.* This is done as a dress rehearsal for pacing, nutrition, equipment. It’s long (\~7h) but usually not all at once intensity – still, it’s the hardest workout mentally and physically. Often scheduled 4 weeks out, followed by a light recovery block. \- **Taper-intensity**: At 3 weeks out, last heavy run (maybe 2.5h easy or a long brick with 1h run). Then volume starts to drop. However, *some intensity is maintained* to keep the edge: e.g. 2 weeks out, do a short swim time trial (e.g. 1500m TT), a bike workout like 3×10’ at threshold (sharpen legs)[\[112\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/essential-run-advice-coach-brett-sutton/?scope=anon#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20most%20beneficial%20run%20I%E2%80%99d,%E2%80%9D), and a run of 1h with 2×10’ at race pace. These are far enough from race to recover, but ensure the athlete doesn’t feel flat. \- **Taper (2 weeks to race):** Volume is cut \~30–50%. E.g. if peak was 15h/week, two weeks out \~10h, race week \~6h plus the race. Focus on rest, nutrition (carb load timing), and *specific skills*: practice transitions, bike packing, etc. Workouts are short and priming: swims with a few race-pace 100s, bikes with a few 2–3min efforts, runs with some strides. Nothing that induces lasting soreness.

**Adaptations: Elite vs Amateur** – An elite pro’s “traditional” base might be 25h/week of mostly Z1, whereas an amateur’s base might be 10h/week. The *relative* distribution remains similar (like 80–90% easy). For amateurs, the base phase often can’t be as long (limited time), so coaches may shorten it to avoid stagnation – e.g. maybe 4 weeks base instead of 8\. Also, amateurs might integrate intensity slightly earlier in micro-doses (like strides) to compensate for their lower volume – whereas elites get plenty stimulus from sheer volume.

One big adaptation: **long run length.** Pros might run 2.5–3h in training (some even do marathon training runs). Many coaches cap amateurs’ long run \~2–2.5h to reduce injury risk, instead using frequency or split runs to increase volume (e.g. 90min morning \+ 30min evening). Mark Allen famously never ran over 2h training for Ironman, focusing on consistency instead. This athlete, with a durable history, might push to \~2h30 for confidence, but only if injury-free.

**Example Microcycle (Build Phase, mid-volume amateur, \~15h/week):**

* **Monday:** REST (or optional recovery swim 30min easy). *After weekend’s big sessions, off completely to rejuvenate.*

* **Tuesday:** AM: Swim 1h (main set: 5×300m at steady effort, some 50m sprints at end for form). PM: Run 1h including 3×10min at tempo (Zone3) with 2min jog rest[\[111\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/essential-run-advice-coach-brett-sutton/?scope=anon#:~:text=a,done%20at%20a%20conversational%20pace). \+ Core strength 15min.

* **Wednesday:** Bike 2h rolling terrain, easy (Zone1–2). Include 3×5min low-cadence (50rpm) climbs at moderate effort to maintain strength. All else easy spinning.

* **Thursday:** AM: Swim 1.2h (main: 3×600m at approx. threshold pace, 1min rest – honing swim endurance). PM: Bike 1.5h with interval set: 2×15min @ 95% FTP[\[113\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,a%20decent%20pace%20at%20threshold) (5min easy between), then 20min easy spin. Follow with quick brick run 20min easy off the bike.

* **Friday:** Run 45min easy (Zone1) \+ 6×20s strides at 5K effort in last 10min (full recovery between strides). This run is for recovery and form – relaxed pace.

* **Saturday:** Big day – *Brick*: Bike 4.5h (target NP \~70% FTP overall). Plan route over several hills similar to Leeds; practice fueling every 15min. Include 2×20min sustained at IM power on long climbs. Immediately off bike, run 50min steady @ goal IM pace (should feel moderate). In brick runs, athlete checks form and fueling (“do I feel like I could continue?” – if yes, pacing is good).

* **Sunday:** Run 2h easy on a hilly route (some trail if available to minimize pounding). Aim is time on feet. Keep HR \< LT1 (a true long slow run). If particularly tired from Saturday, can shorten to 90min or run/walk. Later in day, 30min recovery spin or an easy swim to flush legs.

This microcycle shows the traditional ethos: long aerobic work anchored by a couple of structured quality sessions (Thurs bike intervals, Tue run tempo). The athlete gets plenty of low-intensity volume but also a taste of intensity to progress fitness.

**Common Mistakes & How Consistency is Maintained:** In base, a big mistake is going too hard (turning easy rides into moderate ones) – coaches often preach “don’t spike the heart rate” and use tools like zone alarms or strict power caps. In build, error is adding too much intensity too quickly – this is mitigated by following the rule of thumb: **no more than 10–15% of weekly volume as high intensity** initially[\[116\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=Zone%202%20is%20first%20threshold,been%20on%20cross%20country%20skiiers)[\[31\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=Zone%203%20is%20above%20second,been%20on%20cross%20country%20skiiers). Also, spreading intensity: e.g. not scheduling hard run and hard bike back-to-back without sufficient recovery.

This method values *consistency above all*: an athlete is better off hitting 90% of workouts steadily than overcooking one workout and being shelved. Many coaches implement a repeating weekly structure (like above) to create a rhythm – this predictability helps athletes mentally and physically adapt. Over 12+ weeks, that consistency yields big gains. Traditional plans allow flexibility if fatigue accumulates: since volume is high, an extra rest day can be inserted with minimal guilt (missing one easy ride out of many won’t derail the plan). By the taper, the athlete has months of aerobic training banked, enabling a solid Ironman performance as long as pacing is conservative early on (the mantra: “Don’t go out too hard – trust your base fitness to carry you in the final 10K”).

### 2\. “Trisutto” Reverse Periodization & Strength Focus – *“The Hustle & Muscle Method”*

**What It Is:** A contrarian periodization where intensity precedes volume, championed by coach Brett Sutton. It also emphasizes strength-oriented training for triathlon: using tools like paddles in swim, big gears on bike, and hills for run to build resilience. The plan is less structured by strict weeks and more by block and coach’s intuition. It’s tailored daily but has clear phases.

**Overview of Phases:** Instead of Base→Build→Peak, we have **Speed/Strength Phase** (early), **Conversion Phase** (mid, bridging into endurance), **Endurance Phase** (late, high volume), then **Taper**.

**Speed/Strength Phase (e.g. \~Oct–Jan for a summer race, or Weeks 17–13 in a 17-week plan if starting “late”):** The idea is to “keep the pop” and even increase it after the season break. So initially: \- **Swim:** Lots of strength tools: nearly every swim uses a pull buoy, often paddles and band. Example set: 40×50m as 25m fast / 25m easy, all with paddles (this builds power while keeping form under fatigue)[\[23\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/reverse-periodisation-and-the-new-way-forward#:~:text=it%E2%80%99s%20short%20and%20sharp,keep%20it%20short%20and%20keep). Volume is moderate (2.5–3k per session) but intensity is high (many efforts \~1500m to 400m race pace). Sutton doesn’t emphasize kick or pure drills (“no wasted time on things that don’t directly improve tri swim” – he trains triathletes in a more strength-biased way)[\[117\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=%2A%20Cycling%20at%2060,as%20it%20keeps%20your%20form). \- **Bike:** Key sessions are **high-threshold intervals** and **low-cadence work**. For example: 5×5min at just above FTP (effort “9/10”) with 3min rest, done on trainer – this elevates power. Another staple: 20×1min on, 1min off, big gear (like 50×12 gearing) at low cadence (\~60rpm) – on “on” minutes, push \~110–120% FTP[\[117\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=%2A%20Cycling%20at%2060,as%20it%20keeps%20your%20form). These hurt but build immense muscular force. Ride frequency might be 4–5×/week but shorter rides (1–2h). Little traditional “LSD” – maybe a 2–3h ride on Sunday but still including efforts. \- **Run:** Surprisingly in this phase, *no long runs*. Instead, frequent shorter runs (some off the bike). Running might be 4–6× a week but mostly 30–60min sessions. Workouts: one would be track intervals at 3k–5k race pace, but *not to failure* (e.g. 3 sets of 5×300m fast, 100m jog – totaling \~4.5km of speed, done at \~90% full sprint). Or hill repeats: find a 200m steep hill, do 10 repeats fast uphill, jog down. Sutton often prescribes fartleks: e.g. 8km of fartlek where you surge 15s fast/45s steady – these keep pace variation. **Volume is low; intensity moderate-high.** He keeps run efforts submaximal (no all-out sprints beyond 15s, to avoid injury)[\[14\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=How%20could%20you%20possibly%20advocate,work%20without%20a%20base). Recovery runs or “Sutto shuffle” easy runs are included as needed, but running each day is discouraged (he often says AGers, especially women, should not run daily to avoid orthopedic strain[\[84\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/essential-run-advice-coach-brett-sutton/?scope=anon#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20my%20belief%20that%20the,%E2%80%9D)). \- **Strength & Conditioning:** In this method, formal weightlifting is minimal (some core or conditioning circuits may be done, but Brett relies on “sport-specific strength” – hills, big gear – to do the job[\[118\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,much%20success%20in%20this%20area)). However, *functional strength* (stability, mobility) might be integrated via warm-ups, e.g. some band work for hips, ankle strength exercises, etc., given the intensity coming.

This phase might last \~4–6 weeks in a 17-week program (or longer if starting way in off-season). Signs to move on: the athlete’s FTP and pace improve noticeably, and they begin to show a bit of fatigue from intensity (or risk plateau). At that point, Sutton would shift gears.

**Conversion Phase (bridge from speed to endurance, e.g. Weeks 12–9):** Here the goal is to “convert” some of that speed into endurance and start layering in more aerobic work while maintaining some intensity: \- **Swim:** Increase total distance per session somewhat (to 3–4k). Include longer reps like 5×400m at a strong effort (near threshold but not all-out). Still use paddles often but maybe some pure swims to gauge improvement. Possibly an open-water skills session if accessible (practice sighting, continuous swim of 1500–2000m). \- **Bike:** Volume starts to rise. Long ride is introduced or extended to \~4h. But to keep athletes mentally engaged, might break it as: “every hour do 10min hard (Z4 climb or big gear), remainder easy-mod.” This way, volume and intensity co-exist. During conversion, still do one threshold session a week but perhaps slightly lower intensity than before. For instance, instead of 5×5’ @ 105% FTP, do 3×10’ @ 100% FTP. Low-cadence work continues because it’s a hallmark (maybe now included within long rides on hills rather than standalone). \- **Run:** Long run finally enters chat. It might be only \~75–90 min to start, since athlete hasn’t gone long in a while. But given they have speed, they’ll cover decent distance. A good practice: break long run into double run day (morning 60min \+ evening 30min) to accumulate distance safely – Sutton often prefers splitting for those not ready to handle 2h straight. Intensity wise, still do short faster stuff but now slightly longer reps: e.g. 5×1000m at 10K pace, or hill repeats of 90s uphill. One enjoyable workout here is the “Kenyan day” – a strength run session: find a rolling course and run 60min continuous but surge every hill and coast the downhills (this marries strength \+ aerobic). \- **Brick frequency increases:** Perhaps every week a short brick – e.g. a 3h ride with varied pacing, immediately into a 40min run moderate. The run might include a fast finish 5–10min at near 70.3 pace to start simulating that tired leg feel. Sutton historically had athletes do many short bricks – e.g. 30min run after most bike sessions, even if easy[\[119\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,good%20to%20reduce%20injury%20risk). This “run often off the bike” philosophy (short runs) is a distinguishing feature – it trains the neuromuscular adaptation without much extra volume.

Volume by end of this phase: maybe up to \~12–14h/week. The athlete should now be comfortable doing longer aerobic stints, but with still a good amount of high-end maintained.

**Endurance Phase (Peak Volume, Weeks 8–4 out):** Now the heavy aerobic training comes in “closer to race season”[\[120\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,volume%20closer%20to%20race%20season). The aim is to maximize aerobic capacity and specific endurance **without losing the hard-earned speed**. How: \- **Significantly extend long sessions:** Long ride goes to 5–6h repeatedly (some might do back-to-back days of long rides). Example: 3 weeks of 5h, 5.5h, 6h long rides. These may be done with training partners or camps (Sutton likes high-volume camps \~6 weeks out). On these rides, intensity is mostly Zone2 but *he may sprinkle some spice*, e.g. last hour progressive to IM effort, or a big gear climb mid-ride. \- **Long run** extends to \~2h or slightly more (for AG, maybe 2h15 max). Notably, in one TriSutto example, an athlete might do 30k long run but rarely more. They might also do occasional split long runs (e.g. 1h morning \+ 1h evening on same day \= 2h total but easier on body). \- **Race-specific bricks:** Very important in this phase. E.g. a brick like 4h ride (with lots of hills) \+ 1h run at goal IM pace. Sutton often under-distances the run: he’d rather you do slightly less but recover well to train next day than slog a full 2h after a ride. For instance, Chrissie Wellington rarely ran over 1h off the bike in training; instead, she’d run 30–60min but frequently. \- **Intensity toned down but not absent:** Typically two quality sessions remain per week but more polarized: one might be a short VO₂max hit to keep top-end (e.g. 8×2min very hard on bike with big rest – enough to remember how to suffer but not enough to generate deep fatigue), and one threshold-ish workout, but perhaps integrated in bricks (like do a 3×1mi at threshold in middle of a mid-week 90min run). \- **Swim volume up:** More swims of 4k+. One key set might be a straight 3.8k or a 60min continuous swim to build confidence for the Ironman distance. Or multiple 1000s (e.g. 3×1000 at race effort, 1min rest). Still include one session of short fast 50s with paddles to keep strength.

Volume peaks: could be 16–20 hr for this amateur (Sutton pros might hit 30h in final camp). He’s known for doing big over-distance for some (like 8h bike, or big swim blocks). For our athlete with limited time, maybe they manage one “camp week” of 18h where they simulate extra volume on a holiday weekend.

**Taper (Weeks 3–0):** Interestingly, Sutton’s taper can be short. He often says don’t over-taper because you’ll lose that hard-earned strength. For example, Daniela Ryf in 2018 reportedly hadn’t done a ride over 2h until 8 weeks out, then ramped, and was still doing big sessions within 2 weeks of Kona[\[26\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=running%20which%20is%20good%20to,reduce%20injury%20risk). A likely approach: \- 3 weeks out: slightly reduced volume (\~75% peak) but still a solid training week. \- 2 weeks out: if race is key, cut volume further (\~50–60% of peak). Keep intensity spikes: e.g. a set of 1min hard bike intervals, some short fast runs – just to stay sharp. \- 10 days out: Most strenuous sessions done. Perhaps 10 days out a last brick like 3h ride \+ 30min run but all easy. Then final week mostly rest with a few short tune-ups: e.g. 15min swim with a few fast 50s, 30min bike with 2×2min at race power, etc. \- He likes to keep athletes a bit hungry – better slightly underdone than overdone. Given the athlete’s durability, a moderate taper is fine (they don’t need a full 3 weeks of extreme rest). \- *Psychological aspect:* Reverse-trained athletes often enter taper confident in their speed but a bit unsure of endurance because they piled endurance on late. The coach’s job is to reassure them that the work is there.

**Key Sessions / Examples:** \- **Triple Brick (advanced):** Sutton has used multiple bricks in a day to simulate cumulative fatigue. E.g. Bike 2h \+ Run 30min in morning, then again midday, then again late afternoon (total 6h bike, 1.5h run but split). This is brutal but effective to mimic Ironman fatigue without one continuous injury-inducing run. \- **The “Monster Day”:** Another strategy near peak: Swim 4k in morning, Bike 5h midday, Run 1h evening (separated but in one day). This overloads endurance in all three – an amateur might try a mini version: Swim 3k, Bike 4h, Run 40min. \- **Moderate Marathon (for strong runners):** Some of Brett’s athletes have done a stand-alone marathon in training at an easier pace (maybe 4–6 weeks out) to build strength. However, this is high risk for injury for many; likely not needed for our athlete given multiple IMs done recently.

**Elite vs Amateur Adjustments:** Brett’s elite women (Ryf, Wellington) could handle enormous training loads and recover well – he exploited that. Amateurs cannot replicate the volume, so the key is to capture the *principles*: early intensity, late volume, and strength focus – but scaled. For instance, an age-grouper might do 2 quality sessions/week in speed phase instead of 4 that a pro might do. And their “big volume” weeks might be 15h, not 30h. Also, amateurs need to be more cautious with intensity to avoid injury – so maybe fewer run intervals and more cross-training early on (or using tools like an AlterG treadmill or aqua jogging if one can afford – though not common, but conceptually reduce impact).

**What Transfers to Race:** The athlete from this program will have: \- High power-to-weight for climbs (from all the strength biking). \- Ability to handle surges (from interval training). \- Good muscular endurance from the concentrated block of long workouts close to the race. \- Experience running on very tired legs (owing to frequent bricks). However, a risk is pacing: Because they got fit fast and only did super-long steady efforts later, they must be careful not to overcook the early race due to that residual speed. Sutton’s athletes often have coaches on course or very strict instructions to rein in early effort.

**Sample Week Comparison (Speed phase vs Endurance phase):**

* *Week 16 out (Speed focus):* Mon swim \+ short run; Tue bike intervals, Wed swim \+ run intervals, Thu off, Fri bike big gear \+ short brick run, Sat swim \+ long-ish fartlek run (1h), Sun bike 3h hilly (with sprints) \+ brick run 20min.

* *Week 4 out (Endurance focus):* Mon easy swim; Tue long brick (5h ride \+ 45min run), Wed swim \+ recovery jog, Thu bike 1.5h with few hard efforts \+ brick run 30min mod, Fri long run 2h, Sat swim (continuous 3.8k) \+ easy bike 2h, Sun bike 6h (simulation on hilly terrain, practice aero nutrition etc).

Notice the shift: early week had 3h longest ride, later 6h; early had run intensity, later long slow run; early had a lot of fast components, later more steady.

**Maintaining Consistency:** This approach is arguably *less formulaic*, so consistency comes from coach oversight or athlete’s ability to read themselves. There are some “rules”: \- Hard efforts never exceed 90–95% max – this prevents injury and allows repeating weekly without burnout[\[14\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=How%20could%20you%20possibly%20advocate,work%20without%20a%20base). \- If an athlete shows signs of deep fatigue (e.g. can’t hit targets, mood drop), a very easy “down week” is inserted (Brett’s group might have an ad hoc 3–4 days almost off). \- Day-to-day, the next workout is adjusted based on previous day: e.g. if an athlete crushed a big gear session and is cooked, the next day’s run might be downgraded to easy (flexibility). \- Brett famously demands athletes trust him and not overthink – this psychological consistency (no chopping/changing methods) is key[\[121\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,his%20success%20with%20female%20athletes). For a self-coached athlete, that means *commit to the plan outlines and avoid second-guessing mid-stream*. If following Trisutto method, don’t panic and do extra long rides in speed phase or vice versa.

**Common Mistakes:** Doing either phase half-heartedly. E.g. some try reverse periodization but still also do long rides in winter (thus they neither gain full speed nor truly rest in winter – result: suboptimal). Or neglecting aerobic phase – some get addicted to intensity and don’t ramp volume enough later, arriving short on endurance. Another mistake: not cutting intensity enough when volume ramps (some age-groupers attempt to keep doing HIIT while suddenly doing 15h weeks – often leads to illness/injury). The method works if you **truly shift focus** and let some qualities drop a bit while others rise, trusting they’ll come back. “Keep the cup full” means don’t entirely neglect aerobic base while chasing speed – in practice maybe that means still having one longer session even in speed phase (e.g. a 2h aerobic ride) so you’re not starting from zero when volume increases[\[122\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=chance%20of%20mental%20burnout%20because,as%20it%20keeps%20your%20form).

For our athlete, a reverse approach could be refreshing – they have a big race history last year (3 IMs). They might benefit from backing off long stuff initially, rebuilding power, then hitting endurance. But they’d need to be honest about fatigue and not try to maintain peak intensity all the way.

### 3\. Polarized 80/20 – *“Go Slow to Go Fast”* (with Ironman adaptations)

**What It Is:** A training model where \~80% of training time is at low intensity (easy/aerobic) and \~20% at high intensity (well above threshold), with minimal training in between. In practice for triathlon, it often results in a lot of Zone1/2 volume and a couple of hard interval sessions per week[\[31\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=Zone%203%20is%20above%20second,been%20on%20cross%20country%20skiiers)[\[123\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=We%20compete%20for%20a%20longer,without%20doing%20VO2%20max%20work). It became popular through Stephen Seiler’s research and books like Matt Fitzgerald’s “80/20 Triathlon.” For Ironman, pure polarization is tweaked toward pyramidal in many cases[\[47\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=time%20at%20a%20higher%20intensity,is%20likely%20to%20be%20beneficial), but we’ll discuss it in relatively pure form, noting necessary mods for Ironman specifics.

**Base Phase (if using polarized year-round, base just has no high intensity yet)**: Actually, a polarized approach often still has a “base” but it might include some intensity even in base (unlike traditional LSD which has none). However, many coaches do a short pure base (all easy) then implement 80/20 distribution once a reasonable volume is achieved. \- Suppose the athlete builds to 10hr/week of mostly Z1 in 4 weeks (this is “base”). \- Then they add intervals.

**Build Phase (Polarized style, e.g. Weeks 13–5):** \- **Intensity sessions:** Typically 2–3 per week. For triathletes with three sports, often 1 hard bike, 1 hard run, and maybe every second week a hard swim (since swim intensity has lower injury risk, some do more frequent short hard swim sets anyway). \- Common interval formats: long VO₂ intervals (4–8min at \~VO₂max pace) or short HIT (30s–1min very hard, short rest). Example: one week might have 5×5min @ 120% FTP on Tuesday bike[\[7\]](https://www.tri247.com/race-day-tips/half-ironman-middle-distance-triathlon-pacing-hills-fuelling-race-day-tips#:~:text=On%20the%20climbs%2C%20try%20to,have%20a%20few%20pennies%20left), and e.g. 6×3min at 5K pace on Thursday run. These are very taxing, but then the rest of that day and next day are easy training or off. \- **Low days:** The other \~5 days of training are all low intensity – meaning easy aerobic rides, recovery runs, relaxed swims. The athlete strictly avoids going moderate. Tools used: lots of conversation-pace work, nose-breathing test (if you can’t breathe through nose, you’re too hard), or HR \< \~75% max on easy days. \- **Volume maintenance:** Polarized training still values volume – e.g. long ride and long run every week, done easy. Our athlete might do a 4h easy ride and a 2h easy run weekly throughout. They accumulate big aerobic base via these sessions. \- There’s often no “tempo” rides or runs scheduled. If the athlete has a group ride or tri club run that tends to go moderate hard, a polarized plan would classify that as a hard session (since it’s above LT1) – meaning it would count into the 20%, potentially replacing an interval day. Many 80/20 plans for amateurs allow one group ride as the intensity for the week for fun, plus one structured interval workout. \- **Progression:** Typically comes by increasing interval volume slightly or making them more intense. But since high-intensity load is capped \~20%, progression also comes from *increasing low-intensity volume* (if possible). For instance, going from 8h/week to 12h/week while keeping 20% intensity effectively increases absolute amount of intensity too. But often amateurs hold hours constant and manipulate interval difficulty instead.

**Peak/Race Prep (Weeks 4–1):** Here’s where a pure polarized approach would possibly incorporate more race-specific work. Some 80/20 advocates (Fitzgerald) suggest staying mostly polarized even in Ironman build, but including small amounts of race-pace (Zone2) as part of long workouts or via bricks to ensure specificity. Without it, an athlete might not be accustomed to 6+ hours at moderate effort. So: \- Keep doing interval sessions but maybe switch one of them to a “threshold” or tempo focused one (thus temporarily deviating to more pyramidal). E.g. 5 weeks out, instead of VO₂ intervals, do 3×15min at slightly above IM power (like 85% FTP) to simulate climbing sustained – this is Zone2/3 training which isn’t normally “allowed” in polarized, but practical coaches do it for Ironman. \- Long sessions become dress rehearsals: easy long ride might become a negative split ride (first 3h easy, last 1h at IM effort). Or do a few 30min blocks at IM wattage in a long ride. \- The athlete might do a half-IM race or long brick to test gear/nutrition. \- Because high intensity is still present, they maintain top fitness, but might taper intensity down slightly in final 10 days to freshen up.

**Key Sessions:** \- **5×5min VO₂ Bike** – bread and butter to raise power. Conducted on rested legs, probably on a trainer or hill, each rep at \~110–120% FTP (a hard effort you could only sustain \~6min max). \- **3×(5×30s/30s) Run** – short HIT: e.g. run 30s very fast, 30s jog, repeat 5 times (5min block), rest 2min, do 3 blocks. These improve running economy and speed without huge stress. \- **Long run easy** – e.g. 2h Zone1–2 (maybe 20s pick-ups every mile to keep form). \- **Long ride easy** – e.g. 5h at HR zone1 (perhaps include a few 2min hard surges every hour to keep it interesting or simulate passing/cadence change, but generally easy).

**A week example (mid-build, \~12h, polarized distribution):** \- Mon: Swim 45min easy (technique focus), perhaps also 30min recovery run (Z1). \- Tue: Bike VO₂max intervals 1.5h (incl. 5×4’ hard)[\[7\]](https://www.tri247.com/race-day-tips/half-ironman-middle-distance-triathlon-pacing-hills-fuelling-race-day-tips#:~:text=On%20the%20climbs%2C%20try%20to,have%20a%20few%20pennies%20left) \+ 15min easy brick run. \- Wed: OFF or 1h easy ride (active recovery). \- Thu: Run intervals 1h (e.g. 10min warmup, 6×3’ at 3k-5k effort, 2min jog, cool down). \- Fri: Swim 1h with some short fast 50s (swim intensity doesn’t count heavily in legs fatigue, but still intensity for swimming). \- Sat: Long bike 4.5h easy (maybe hills but done at comfortable pace, ensure NP stays low). Use HR or power ceiling – keep VI (variability) low ideally, unless course is hilly. \- Sun: Long run 1h45 easy (Z1); later 30min easy swim or rest.

This gives roughly 2 high-intensity sessions (Tue, Thu runs) plus maybe a bit in swim, which for 12h total might be \~2–2.5h high-intensity \= \~20%. The rest \~80% is easy.

**Adaptation for Ironman**: As mentioned, pure polarized might undertrain muscular endurance. *Case in point:* The study earlier noted that including some Zone2 (tempo) was beneficial for long-course amateurs[\[43\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873141/#:~:text=,Ironman%20race%20in%20recreational%20triathletes) – a nod that pure polarizing (with zero tempo) might leave performance on table. So a smart Ironman polarized plan will become a bit pyramidal nearing race. The athlete might simply replace one VO₂max session with a Zone3 tempo ride or brick. The overall 80/20 by session count might shift to 75/20/5 by time (which is technically more pyramidal). But the philosophy remains: keep a large volume easy and some distinctly hard.

**Pros for amateurs:** Very clear structure – e.g. our athlete with busy life knows two days a week will be very hard, but short; others are comfortable pace. This is easier mentally than medium-hard daily. Additionally, many amateurs *enjoy intensity in group settings* – e.g. track club, Zwift racing – which can fit as the “20” portion. So it can be fun.

**Elite vs Amateur:** Many tri pros actually train pyramidal rather than polarized, except short-course ITU who do a lot of high intensity. But an amateur triathlete might lean polarized because they have less time and want to maximize VO₂ and economy. Key adaptation: amateurs often can’t do as high volume, so a strict 80/20 might give them too little intensity in absolute terms. For example, 20% of 8h is \~1.6h hard – maybe okay. If only 6h/week, 20% is \~1.2h – that might be just one interval session; some may need a bit more. So in practice, lower-volume athletes inadvertently do more like 70/30 by time (or 3 sessions out of 7 might be interval-based which is \~40% by session count). Coaches like Galpin have noted that for low-volume trainers, a higher fraction may need to be intense to elicit adaptation, albeit with caution. But since our athlete has moderate time (10–16h), they can adhere more to classic ratio.

**Maintaining Consistency:** The risk in polarized is some drift into moderate intensity on easy days (the “gray zone”). To avoid this: \- Use tools: e.g. power meter – hold easy ride power \< 65% FTP, HR \< “cap”. Perhaps do easy rides on flat routes or even indoors to avoid accidental hill surges. \- Possibly *polarized training groups*: if others follow same approach, group easy rides where everyone is disciplined (no half-wheeling allowed\!). Or purposely ride/run with slower partners on easy days. \- Stephen Seiler’s advice: “Keep hard days hard and easy days truly easy.” So schedule them such that athlete respects recovery (maybe after a really hard session, the athlete *wants* to go slow next day). \- Another trick: cross-training for easy volume (like hikes, easy cycling if run focus) to break monotony but still keep intensity low.

**Taper in 80/20:** Two weeks out, likely drop volume but maintain a bit of intensity (like a few sharp intervals) to not lose adaptation. Because they do so much easy training, taper might reduce volume by 30–40% but they will keep maybe one short interval session the week of race (like 5×1min fast on Tuesday just to feel “pop”).

**Example of Race Execution from polarized training:** An athlete would have high VO₂max and top gear, meaning on hills they know how to back off to stay aerobic – ironically, they often have *excess capacity*, so climbing at IM wattage feels relatively easy compared to their interval sessions. Their challenge is ensuring they have enough *fueling strategy and muscular endurance* to keep it up after 6 hours. If they included enough long easy rides, they should. In fact, a polarized-trained athlete might negative split the marathon because they have so much aerobic reserve and haven’t slogged moderate paces in training that wear them down. The mental toughness from intervals is a plus: they’ve hurt for 5min intervals, so they handle discomfort well. But they must practice nutrition because doing most training easy might not have stressed fueling as much – hopefully long rides did. Polarized doesn’t inherently practice lots of race nutrition at threshold, but one can incorporate that in long sessions.

### 4\. Pyramidal / “Specific Endurance” Approach – *“Maximum Training for Maximum Gain”*

*(This is essentially the hybrid we’ve touched on – a blend of volume and moderate intensity. Given it’s likely one of the top recommended for our athlete, we’ll examine it with examples from coaches like Dan Lorang and from famed marathon coach Renato Canova’s philosophies as applied to tri.)*

**What It Is:** Pyramidal intensity distribution with a strong focus on **race-specific training** – meaning a lot of work at or near goal race pace/power, plus supplemental training slightly above and below that pace. It is comprehensive: you train all systems, but especially the ones most needed for Ironman: aerobic capacity, muscular endurance, and pacing efficiency.

Dan Lorang (coach of Frodeno, Charles-Barclay) espouses that “low intensity is the primary influencer” but he indeed includes moderate intensity regularly[\[80\]](https://mastersoftri.com/low-intensity-training-is-the-primary-influencer/#:~:text=,trip%20us%20into%20doing%20more)[\[124\]](https://mastersoftri.com/low-intensity-training-is-the-primary-influencer/#:~:text=,low%20intensity%20and%20following%20the). Canova’s marathon model (adapted by some long-course coaches) involves progressive long runs with large portions at marathon pace (for us, Ironman pace on bike or run)[\[91\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=The%20whole%20ideology%20is%20about,potential)[\[49\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=With%20triathlon%2C%20you%20can%27t%20hide,a%20decent%20amount%20of%20volume).

**Base Phase:** Might look similar to traditional base – lots of easy miles. But even in base, a pyramidal approach might throw in “light tempo” now and then. For example, an athlete might do a short tempo during a long ride (like 2×10min at sweet spot) just to keep some touch on it. But mostly base is about building volume and frequency, getting technique right, maybe doing some hill sprints or short efforts to recruit muscles.

**Build Phase:** This is where pyramidal differs from both polarized and threshold-heavy: *it features a good amount of middle-zone training intentionally.* A typical week in build for Ironman: \- One threshold/VO₂max workout (e.g. 6×3min hard running) – not as many as polarized does, but not zero. \- One or two tempo workouts: e.g. a sweet spot bike set (like 3×20’ at 88-92% FTP which is around 70.3 race effort)[\[64\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,sweet%20spot%20as%20the%20base)[\[65\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,and%20it%20does%20elicit%20results), or a “cruise” run like 45min steady at marathon pace (which is slightly below LT threshold). \- Race-pace bricks: commonly every 2–3 weeks, a big brick simulating nutrition and pacing. \- Good volume: multiple sessions across three sports staying mostly easy to allow quality days.

**Progression Strategy:** Often via increasing length of race-pace efforts: For example, over 8 weeks: \- Long ride includes 2×30min at IM wattage in Week 8 out, then 1×90min at IM wattage in Week 5 out, then maybe a continuous 4h at IM wattage in final big ride (some advanced amateurs do a full 180km at goal power in training to prove they can). \- Long run might progress from 60min easy \+ 30min at goal pace, up to 90min easy \+ 45min at goal pace. \- So by race, they have in effect done significant portions at the exact intensity they need.

**Key Sessions Examples:** \- **Canova-style Long Brick:** 4h ride where each hour contains 30min at Ironman power and 30min easy, then off-bike run 90min where first 60min easy, last 30min at target marathon pace. This teaches late-race pace holding. \- **Bike Over-Under intervals:** e.g. 3×(20min @ IM power \+ 5min @ threshold) – total 1h15 with 5min easy between sets. This trains surging then returning to IM pace (good for hills). \- **Run “Durability” set:** 3×5km: 1st 5k at IM marathon pace, 2nd at half-IM pace, 3rd at IM pace again (with short rests like 3min jog). The slightly faster middle helps push lactate up a bit, then finishing at IM pace simulates pushing on tired legs.

**Intensity Balancing:** The distribution might be \~70% low, 25% medium, 5% high by time. This means the athlete still spends majority of time easy, but a quarter in that moderate zone (tempo/threshold). This moderate time includes long stretches of Zone2/3 which are exactly race-specific intensities. As one coach put it: *for Ironman, a lot of training needs to happen at that “gray zone,” because Ironman itself is a 10-hour gray zone.*[\[87\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=We%20compete%20for%20a%20longer,without%20doing%20VO2%20max%20work)[\[105\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=For%20longer%20distance%20triathlon%20which,best%20combination%20is%20for%20you)

**Taper/Peak:** Pyramidal approach tends to taper similar to traditional – reduce volume, keep a bit of intensity. Perhaps drop the moderate volume significantly in last 10 days because you want to come in fresh (but not drop intensity completely).

**Elite vs Amateur:** This approach is basically what a lot of pros do (they just call it “training”). Jan Frodeno’s training, for instance, if you see a week, has some intervals but also a lot at steady moderate intensities in his long sessions. For amateurs, the key adaptation is scale: They cannot do 30k at marathon pace like elites do (that’d kill them). Instead, they might do 15k at marathon pace as peak run workout. They also might need more recovery between hard sessions (pros might do 3 quality a week, amateurs maybe 2 or 3 but smaller). The principle “don’t avoid Zone2” is a big change for those used to hearing “grey zone is bad.” Amateurs adopting this must be disciplined to not turn *every* session moderate (common trap), but to still keep easy days easy. Structure (like the comparative table listed intensity distribution strategies) helps ensure they don’t inadvertently do moderate all the time.

**Maintaining Consistency:** Because moderate work can accumulate fatigue, a common pattern is 2–3 weeks build, 1 week lighter (to allow adaptation). For example, do increasing tempo volume for 3 weeks, then a recovery week with just light training and one short tempo to maintain. Another method: alternate hard and medium weeks – a hard week with more threshold, next week focus on volume but mostly easy, then repeat.

**Common Mistakes:** \- **Too much moderate intensity** – ironically, since it’s allowed, athletes might start riding all “zone2” which ends up being a bit hard daily. To fix this, coaches strictly schedule which workouts are quality and which are truly recovery. \- **Neglecting high-end** – some go pyramidal but forget the 5% high. That 5% (like a weekly VO₂ set) is important to raise VO₂max or efficiency so that the moderate efforts become easier over time. If one only does moderate, they can stagnate (plus it’s mentally draining). \- **Not fueling moderate work** – since lots of race-pace training happens, coaches emphasize practicing fueling during those sessions. If athlete doesn’t, they might bonk or underperform and not realize it’s fueling issue (blaming fitness instead). So they must eat during long tempo bricks just like race.

For our athlete, a pyramidal plan is highly suitable: they have decent time and base, so we can allocate hours nicely between easy and mod/hard. It directly targets “strong bike without destroying run” by repeatedly simulating that balance in training. It’s also sustainable and relatively safe if done right (less extreme intensities than threshold-only, less boredom than all slow).

*(The above deep dives provide a blueprint of how vastly different training philosophies would plan an Ironman season. The athlete reading this can probably see elements of each that appeal. Next, we map real pro athletes to these philosophies to show how theory translates to elite practice, and crucially, what can and cannot be copied from them.)*

## Elite Athlete Mapping to Coaching Philosophies

Understanding how top Ironman and long-course triathletes train – and under which philosophy – can help illustrate each method’s outcomes. Below, we map famous athletes to their coaches/philosophies, highlighting hallmark features of their training, why it worked for them, and what age-groupers should (or shouldn’t) take away.

* **Kristian Blummenfelt** – *The Norwegian Method (Threshold/Pyramidal)*  
  **Coach/Team:** Arild Tveiten and Olav Aleksander Bu (Norwegian Triathlon program)[\[125\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Olav%20Aleksander%20Bu%2C%20Blummenfelt%20and,Norwegian%20Method%20to%20everyday%20triathletes).  
  **Philosophy:** Lactate-controlled threshold training with high volume (pyramidal intensity)[\[8\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=High,as%20high%20as%20you%20think)[\[5\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20easy%2C%20medium%2C%20and%20hard,LT2%29%E2%80%9D). Kristian exemplifies the “science-driven” approach – double threshold sessions, meticulous data tracking, huge aerobic base (\~30h/week)[\[53\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=High,infamous%20aspect%20of%20the%20Norwegian)[\[1\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=ADVERTISEMENT).  
  **Hallmark Training:** Double hard days (e.g. Tue/Thu: AM swim threshold, PM run threshold; Wed/Sat long aerobic days) – basically living around LT2. Frequent lactate testing mid-workout to ensure hitting but not exceeding target intensity[\[55\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=intensity%20might%20not%20be%20as,at%20precisely%20the%20correct%20intensity)[\[5\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20easy%2C%20medium%2C%20and%20hard,LT2%29%E2%80%9D). He also did significant heat and altitude blocks to maximize adaptations. Weeks were very structured: 2 hard days, 1 recovery, repeat. Lots of steady biking and running at 70-80% HRmax too – not polarised in avoiding mid-zone[\[1\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=ADVERTISEMENT)[\[6\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Image%3A%20Norwegian%20Method%20Zones). For instance, Blum’s training leading to Olympic and Ironman wins included sessions like 10×1k run at threshold (2.50-3.00/km pace) with lactate \~3 mM, and 4×15min bike at 320W (just below threshold) – massive volume at those intensities, but carefully controlled so he could handle it almost daily. Long rides and runs were often slightly faster than traditional easy (he might run 20km at 3:45/km pace, which for him is moderate).  
  **What made it work (for him):** Exceptional recovery capacity and durability – he can absorb 35 hours/week. Years of consistent training since youth, which built an aerobic engine that can handle threshold loads. Also, he has a high VO₂max and relatively low VLa max (lactate production rate), meaning he’s physiologically suited to lots of threshold without blowing up. The team’s support (nutrition, etc.) allowed him to not miss sessions. Plus his personality: very high pain tolerance and discipline (able to hold back exactly at prescribed intensity, not more). The testing and knowledge gave him confidence to push knowing it was “in range.”  
  **Non-transferable elements:** The *volume* – few amateurs can train 25–30h week in, week out[\[8\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=High,as%20high%20as%20you%20think)[\[3\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=The%20training%20methods%20we%E2%80%99ll%20discuss,to%20avoid%20injury%20and%20burnout). The extensive lab testing and instant feedback – age groupers won’t have a physiologist pricking their ear every set. Also, double threshold days are risky without pro-level recovery (midday naps, etc.). Blum’s years of base training and no full-time job are huge factors – an amateur jumping into his regime would likely overtrain quickly. His technique in swim/run is world-class efficient – doing so much threshold with poor form could injure an amateur.  
  **Transferable elements:** *Intensity discipline* – not going too hard on easy days and not above threshold on hard days[\[59\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Examples%3A)[\[60\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=The%20same%20principles%20apply%20to,free%20environment). Age-groupers can emulate the “don’t be a workout hero” mantra – keep hard workouts controlled. Using metrics (HR, maybe lactate if keen) to dial in proper zones can be helpful[\[61\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=on%20heart%20rate%20,and%20how%20it%20is%20measured)[\[62\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=The%20Norwegian%20Method%20Lite%20follows,RPE%20for%20strict%20intensity%20discipline). Also, the concept of doing some sustained tempo/threshold work to build endurance can apply in moderation – e.g. one threshold workout a week where you strictly hold target pace and stop if form falters, rather than a smashfest. His fueling strategy (constant intake even during training) is something AGs can copy – Norwegians fuel heavily during workouts to maximize quality and recovery (e.g. 90g carb/hour on bike trainer sessions). Lastly, the **consistency** – Blum rarely misses sessions; age-groupers, within reason, should strive for a plan that they can execute consistently rather than bursts of extra training.

* **Gustav Iden** – *Norwegian Method (Threshold & Tech)*  
  **Coach:** Same team as Blummenfelt (Tveiten/Bu).  
  **Philosophy:** Identical approach – high volume, threshold focus. If anything, Gustav was known for even more attention to detail on aerodynamics and footwear (he famously won Kona 2022 in carbon-plated trainers he helped develop).  
  **Hallmarks:** Gustav’s training logs mirror Kristian’s. One hallmark: incredibly high run mileage (160+ km/week at times) mostly at moderate pace – he once did a marathon in training at \~3:40/km pace feeling comfortable. He often executed workouts on treadmill or measured courses to control variables (even doing threshold runs on an indoor track with lactate measurement). Also big on brick workouts – Gustav frequently did race-pace bricks, e.g. 150k ride at IM pace into 10k run at 3:30/km pace, monitoring lactate to ensure it stayed \~2-3 mM, indicating he was at proper intensity.  
  **Success factors:** Very durable runner (no injuries despite volume). Calm demeanor – suited for monotonous training. Also, he has a natural efficiency – his threshold pace is very close to his race pace (he can sustain a high % of VO₂max for a long time). That’s partly genetic and partly training-induced by threshold model. They also utilized tech heavily: supersapiens glucose monitors, aerometers on bike, etc., to leave nothing to guess.  
  **Non-transferable:** Same as Blummenfelt – volume, pro lifestyle, and the deep integration of sports science (most AG don’t have aerodynamic testing every session or lactate monitors). Gustav also responded well to training load – not everyone has that injury-proof makeup.  
  **Transferable:** The importance of *aerodynamics & equipment*: Gustav winning 70.3 Worlds with a road bike (with short aero bars) taught that being comfortable might trump pure aero. Later, he maximized his Shiv TT position for Kona. Age groupers should take equipment and position seriously – you can gain “free speed” and reduce the physiological cost of going fast (Gustav and team saw that as crucial – not strictly training but in ethos). Also, fueling and heat management – Norwegians did heat chamber training and had precise hydration plans; amateurs doing a hot race can emulate acclimation protocols (sauna sessions, hydration strategies). Lastly, Gustav is known for *not panicking in races*, which comes from his training confidence – AGers can learn that executing your own plan (like he did in Nice 2019\) yields results even if others go out faster.

* **Lionel Sanders** – *High-Intensity Hybrid (from self-coached chaos to scientific refinement)*  
  **Coach(es):** Lionel has had multiple phases – self-coached for years, then coached by David Tilbury-Davis (2017-18), then self-coached again, then engaged Mikal Iden (Gustav’s brother) in 2022\.  
  **Philosophy:** Early on, Lionel’s philosophy was essentially “suffer more than anyone else.” He is famous for extremely hard indoor sessions (TrainerRoad plans, Zwift races, 5-hour trainer rides at high effort) and big volume when motivated. It wasn’t a coherent periodization – he did high volume *and* high intensity (often too much). Later, under guidance, he incorporated more structure: in 2022 he adopted some Norwegian principles (lactate testing, controlled intervals) combined with still a fairly high-intensity approach.  
  **Hallmark Training:** Notorious sessions like 10×1mile run repeats all-out on 1min rest (as a *brick run* after a hard bike\!). Or a 5-hour bike with IF (intensity factor) \~0.85 – basically a threshold ride for 5h, which nearly broke him. He would do 3–4h steady at \~90% FTP regularly (that’s Sweet Spot overload). He also attempted things like a *cycling hour record* training block in midst of tri training. Lionel’s YouTube shows him bleeding through workouts, literally – he once live-streamed a VO₂max test hitting 89 ml/kg. So intensity heavy, but he also put in huge swim weeks (like 60k yard weeks prepping for Kona trying to fix swim). With Mikal Iden, he started *measuring lactate and slowing down* – e.g. he found his easy rides were producing 4 mM lactate (too hard), so he backed off[\[126\]](https://forum.slowtwitch.com/t/what-is-the-norwegian-triathlon-training-bible/815399#:~:text=Lionel%20Sanders%20summarised%20the%20NOR,That%27s%20pretty%20much%20it). He embraced double-threshold days for a while and more 80/20-ish distribution.  
  **Why it (sort of) worked:** Lionel’s mental drive is off the charts. He can push himself solo in a basement as hard as others in a race. Early successes (several 70.3 wins, Kona 2nd in 2017\) came arguably from brute force – high pain tolerance built a big engine. He responded to intensity – his VO₂max was one of highest recorded in tri, and raising his FTP via lots of threshold made him a bike powerhouse. However, his lacking structure also led to inconsistency (some spectacular bonks or poor races likely from overtraining). Another advantage: minimal injury issues – ironically, despite unsupervised training, he’s rarely had major run injuries; perhaps his background (from overweight to pro) gave him some durability or he just managed to not break, possibly thanks to focusing more on bike and less extreme run mileage.  
  **Non-transferable:** The extreme training impulses – he could ride 5h at 300W on Zwift because he’s Lionel, most others would implode or lose motivation. His volume spikes (like 35h weeks out of nowhere) are not models to copy. Also, his ability to *survive* on poor structure is unique. He famously said he did 14 rides of 5h at 300W leading to Kona; an amateur copying that would almost certainly overtrain or not absorb it. His mental approach – he thrives off proving people wrong and going to dark places – that can easily lead an amateur to burnout or quitting the sport if they try to suffer that much.  
  **Transferable:** Lionel’s later realization: **focus on weaknesses**. He spent years ignoring swim, then finally committed to swim blocks, joining a squad – amateurs often neglect their worst discipline, but it’s key to work on it (with coaching, if possible). Also, his adoption of science later is a cautionary tale – after stagnation, he got a coach and saw improvement again in 2021-22 (podium at 70.3 Worlds, etc.). The message: even the toughest guy needed smart training. So AGers can learn that balancing intensity with easy training (Lionel’s now a proponent of holding back on easy days) is crucial[\[126\]](https://forum.slowtwitch.com/t/what-is-the-norwegian-triathlon-training-bible/815399#:~:text=Lionel%20Sanders%20summarised%20the%20NOR,That%27s%20pretty%20much%20it). His use of tools like lactate meter, while maybe overkill for some, at least shows measuring progress (like doing field tests, monitoring HR trends) can guide training rather than just hammering blind. Lionel also speaks openly about nutrition failures (he under-fueled some races, bonked at Kona 2019\) – since then he refined fueling (taking \~100g carbs/hour on bike). AGers can definitely copy that: practice and optimize race nutrition, don’t wing it. Mentally, Lionel’s relentless attitude is inspirational, but a better takeaway is his *resilience to setbacks* – he’s had awful races (e.g. 54min swim at Kona, walking the marathon) and uses them to come back smarter. Age-groupers who have a bad race can channel their inner Lionel to not quit but analyze and improve.

* **Jan Frodeno** – *High-Volume Aerobic & Precision Execution (Pyramidal)*  
  **Coach:** Dan Lorang (from 2014 onward; previously coached by Joel Filliol and also consulted with various mentors like Faris Al-Sultan for a time).  
  **Philosophy:** A balanced, high-volume program with emphasis on consistent aerobic training and very calculated intensity – essentially pyramidal with a bit of reverse periodization twist (Dan sometimes uses build \-\> VO₂ block \-\> extensive block). Jan is known for doing a lot of miles but also being extremely good at pacing and tactics – “execution” is a hallmark (he rarely falters in race strategy).  
  **Hallmark Training:** Huge bike and run volume – e.g. 800km cycling and 100km running in a big week at peak (those are pro numbers). A lot of that is Z1/Z2 – Jan has said he does majority easy miles because “his coach’s biggest job is to slow him down”[\[80\]](https://mastersoftri.com/low-intensity-training-is-the-primary-influencer/#:~:text=,trip%20us%20into%20doing%20more)[\[124\]](https://mastersoftri.com/low-intensity-training-is-the-primary-influencer/#:~:text=,low%20intensity%20and%20following%20the). Key sessions reported include long rides 180–200km in Girona hills, often with big climbs (he’ll do 5×20min climb at upper Zone2 on a long ride). Long runs \~35–38km often on hilly trails at aerobic pace (but he also did road sessions of e.g. 3×5km at 3:20/km pace with 1km float – indicating some Canova-style marathon sessions). Jan also uses **brick workouts** extensively – famously, leading into Kona 2019 he did multiple 180km bike \+ 10–15km run bricks at race effort in heat. He’s meticulous with heat acclimation (stays in Girona until just before Kona but uses sauna, overdressing, etc.). Another hallmark: **altitude training** – he’s spent blocks in St. Moritz high altitude every year, which boosts his aerobic base. In intensity, he doesn’t do a ton of top-end outside early season; Lorang noted Jan’s program is mostly aerobic, with maybe one intensity set a week except in specific VO₂ blocks[\[80\]](https://mastersoftri.com/low-intensity-training-is-the-primary-influencer/#:~:text=,trip%20us%20into%20doing%20more)[\[94\]](https://mastersoftri.com/low-intensity-training-is-the-primary-influencer/#:~:text=shows%20their%20commitment%20to%20consistency,not%20necessarily).  
  **What worked for him:** Jan has an extensive background (Olympic gold in 2008\) so years of base. His body thrives on volume – he once said if he doesn’t run 100km/week he loses run form. So they maintain high run miles for durability. His mental focus is legendary; he executes training like clockwork and spares no detail (e.g. he would practice flying mounts in his 30s to save seconds). He also leverages tech – e.g. internal core temp sensors to pace heat workouts, and a large support team (physio, nutritionist). But a big factor: **consistency** – he rarely has off-season slacking; he’s either training or recovering intentionally. This consistent high load gave him an “aerobic durability” edge – in races, he simply doesn’t slow down like others in final 10k. Also, his training around race pace (especially on bike) meant on race day he exactly nails power targets.  
  **Non-transferable:** The sheer volume and time – as a full-time pro with staff, he can train 35h/wk and recover optimally. His altitude camps – an amateur might not afford to go live at 1800m for 3 weeks. And his natural talent & experience: he was an ITU world champion – his swim is so refined that he doesn’t need as much intensity there. Age-groupers might not replicate his session paces (e.g. running 20 miles at 6:00/mi as a training run). Additionally, he’s had injuries (bike crash, stress fractures); pros can take a season off to heal – amateurs might quit or not have means to manage such breaks.  
  **Transferable:** *Consistency and planning.* Jan periodizes well – base phase where he might do a 3-week big volume push, then a recovery week – amateurs can mimic that pattern (3:1 loading). Also precision: he always negative splits in Kona, indicating perfect pacing; age-groupers should strive to hold back early and finish strong – a directly applicable tactic. His mantra of “don’t try anything new on race day” – he tests nutrition, gear thoroughly. Another transferable aspect is focusing on **technique & efficiency**: Jan still does swim drills and run form work – amateurs often neglect that, but investing time in skill can pay dividends. And *strength training*: Jan does functional strength and rehab exercises to address weaknesses (especially post-injury). Incorporating appropriate strength work to remain injury-free is wise for amateurs too. Lastly, Jan is big on **listening to the body** – Lorang mentioned Jan knows when to push or when to back off if something feels off[\[94\]](https://mastersoftri.com/low-intensity-training-is-the-primary-influencer/#:~:text=shows%20their%20commitment%20to%20consistency,not%20necessarily)[\[127\]](https://mastersoftri.com/low-intensity-training-is-the-primary-influencer/#:~:text=process%20laid%20out%20by%20Dan,not%20necessarily). Age groupers should similarly adjust if signs of injury or overtraining appear.

* **Patrick Lange** – *Run-Centric Durability & Aerobic Efficiency*  
  **Coach:** Was coached by Faris Al-Sultan during his 2017-2018 Kona wins. Later by Björn Geesmann.  
  **Philosophy:** Patrick leveraged his run background (ex-duathlete) to focus on strong off-bike running. Training wise, he had relatively lower bike volume than some rivals but high-intensity bike sessions (under Faris, reportedly a polarized-ish approach on bike). His run training was about efficiency – a lot at comfortable pace to avoid injury and develop aerobic base, plus key brick runs. **Hallmarks:** Known for fast marathons (sub-2:40 in Kona). He often did brick runs of 60–80 minutes off long rides at goal marathon pace – building that specific durability. His weekly run mileage wasn’t massive (\~60–70 km/wk) but quality: many race-pace efforts and heat runs. On the bike, Faris had him do intervals (e.g. 4×10min at 70.3 power) to raise power but not over-bike in training. And long rides were done in the heat of day in Kona build to simulate conditions. Patrick’s swim was moderate (usually middle of pack), so they just maintained it – about 15k/week. **What worked:** Incredible run economy (light, efficient stride) – allowed him to sustain high pace in heat. His focus on *not slowing down on the run* meant he specifically trained negative split runs. He also was rigorous with cooling (used ice, cold towels extensively – something he practiced). His smaller frame possibly helped in heat too. Coach Faris instilled a balanced approach – “we don’t need to ride 180k every week” – they emphasized intensity and overall lower training stress to avoid injury since Patrick had some injuries early in career. That kept him healthy so he could peak right for Kona. **Non-transferable:** Counting on a monster run to bail you out – Patrick could run down opponents but that’s high risk if bike is too slow. Few amateurs have that run prowess to rely on it. Also his ability to handle Kona heat with that speed is unique – not everyone can do 6:00/mile in 35°C even if trained. Another is his relatively low bike volume approach – amateurs often actually need more bike miles to be strong, since they don’t have his efficiency (Patrick’s aero and power-to-weight were good enough). **Transferable:** Brick runs at goal pace – maybe not as long or fast as his, but the concept of running off the bike in training to dial pacing and nutrition. Also focusing on running form and cadence (Patrick runs with very efficient cadence \~92–94) – amateurs can improve economy with drills, etc. Heat acclimation and cooling strategies are big – he famously used mesh cycling jerseys in Kona run to hold ice; amateurs could replicate cooling methods. Faris’s emphasis on *staying injury-free* – sometimes doing less volume – is a good lesson: consistency beats overtraining. Patrick didn’t always win the training “volume war” but showed up healthy and peaked – that’s a direct lesson for age-groupers balancing training load.

* **Lucy Charles-Barclay** – *Swim-Dominant & Aerobic Base with New-Found Structure*  
  **Coach(es):** Initially self-coached with husband Reece Barclay; from 2021 onward, coached by Dan Lorang[\[128\]](https://www.tri247.com/triathlon-news/elite/lucy-charles-barclay-dan-lorang-coaching#:~:text=So%20when%20he%20reached%20out,her%20team%20were%20all%20ears)[\[129\]](https://www.tri247.com/triathlon-news/elite/lucy-charles-barclay-dan-lorang-coaching#:~:text=definitely%20be%20Dan,success%20over%20the%20long%20course).  
  **Philosophy:** Coming from elite swimming, Lucy relied on her swim strength and big aerobic base from swim training (10+ sessions/week as a teen). Early on, her training was high-volume but perhaps not super structured in intensity. Under Lorang, she integrated more scientific training (lab testing, altitude, etc.)[\[130\]](https://www.tri247.com/triathlon-news/elite/lucy-charles-barclay-dan-lorang-coaching#:~:text=The%20appliance%20of%20science)[\[131\]](https://www.tri247.com/triathlon-news/elite/lucy-charles-barclay-dan-lorang-coaching#:~:text=Lucy%20and%20Reece%20have%20always,that%20to%20a%20new%20level). The approach became balanced (lots of low intensity, plus intensity carefully added) similar to Frodeno’s style.  
  **Hallmarks:** *Swim:* she swims \~5 times/week, \~20-25k/week, including with a top swim squad at times. Many paddle/pull sets and high threshold yardage – e.g. main sets like 10×400 holding 1:10/100m pace (which for her is firm but sustainable). This massive swim base gives her an edge with minimal extra fatigue (she can afford to push swim training because it’s her strength). *Bike:* historically a weaker cyclist, she did big bike mileage to improve – 2018-2019 she often logged 300-400 km/week. Also focused on improving aerodynamics and power in TT position (she spent a lot of time on turbo to dial position comfort). Under Lorang, introduced more intervals – e.g. 3×30min at IM power, or VO₂max spurts. *Run:* after a stress fracture in 2021, she adjusted run training to avoid injury: more 70-80k weeks instead of trying 100k too soon, using cross-training (elliptical, aqua running) when needed. Key sessions included brick runs at near half-IM pace (to build speed) and long runs \~2h on soft surfaces. Lucy also did significant *altitude camps* (notably, St. Moritz in 2021 which she credited for 70.3 Worlds win)[\[132\]](https://www.tri247.com/triathlon-news/elite/lucy-charles-barclay-dan-lorang-coaching#:~:text=Aiming%20high%20%E2%80%93%20literally%20%E2%80%93,pays%20off)[\[133\]](https://www.tri247.com/triathlon-news/elite/lucy-charles-barclay-dan-lorang-coaching#:~:text=looking%20at%20it,gonna%20be%20a%20month%20away). Altitude plus Lorang’s structured plan (with more testing, as she noted doing lab testing to confirm her training zones) leveled up her bike/run.  
  **Why it works for her:** Her swim gives a huge aerobic engine and doesn’t tax her like others – she can train bike/run hard while maintaining swim form with relative ease. Her youthful swim background might also give her recovery advantages (many years of two-a-days builds resilience). She’s extremely motivated and coachable – switching to Lorang, she followed his plan “to the letter” and saw instant success (70.3 World title in 2021). The integration of science helped target her weaker areas (like improving VLa max on bike to have better endurance). Also, being female, high-volume approach suits her (evidence often suggests females respond well to volume – which Brett Sutton even noted[\[134\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=He%20commented%20that%20they%20were,to%20a%20volume%20based%20approach)).  
  **Non-transferable:** The ability to swim 48min Ironman then still bike with front pack – that’s her rare talent. Age groupers even if former swimmers often still struggle on bike after; Lucy’s one of few who can essentially shrug off a hard swim. Also, her rapid progress under Lorang had context: she had plateaued, so adding structure gave huge gains – not all AGers will see such dramatic improvement because many already follow structure. The sheer amount of training (she does near men’s volume on swim and bike) is beyond normal: e.g. 30h weeks often. Her sponsorships allow total focus – e.g. time in wind tunnel, going to Utah 3 weeks early for acclimation[\[132\]](https://www.tri247.com/triathlon-news/elite/lucy-charles-barclay-dan-lorang-coaching#:~:text=Aiming%20high%20%E2%80%93%20literally%20%E2%80%93,pays%20off) – AGers can’t replicate all.  
  **Transferable:** Embrace **structure and data** when trying to break a plateau – Lucy realized just working harder wasn’t enough, she needed smart training. Many AGers who stall could use a coach or plan to bring method to their routine. Also, **altitude training benefits** – while not everyone can go to St. Moritz, perhaps using a simulated altitude tent or doing “train high, compete low” for key races could yield gains (if done right). Another one: Lucy improved her *bike position and strength* – she did gym work for core and glutes (to help her bike, and support the run to avoid injury). Basic strength training and a professional bike fit can hugely help amateurs as well. And regarding *injury comeback*: Lucy had a serious fracture, but she cross-trained diligently (swimming and aqua jogging) to maintain fitness and came back arguably stronger. AGers facing injury can learn to do what training they can (in water, etc.) rather than quitting all exercise. Lucy’s story also underscores **balancing your strength vs weaknesses** – she never let her swim slip (still often fastest) while improving bike/run. AGers should similarly leverage their strength in races but not neglect weaker disciplines in training.

* **Daniela Ryf** – *High-Volume Aerobic & Strength (Sutton Method)*  
  **Coach:** Brett Sutton (2014-2022).  
  **Philosophy:** Brett’s methodology (reverse periodization, lots of strength work, not overly data-driven). Daniela is known for massive training blocks (she can handle insane volume) and a lot of it not at high-tech intensity but rather “grind it out” style.  
  **Hallmarks:** Swim: a strong swimmer originally, she still swam \~20k/week, often with band+paddles (Brett has them do band-only swimming to build strength – Daniela could swim 400m band-only as training). Bike: huge volume – reportedly, she did regular 7h rides and in peak Kona prep might ride \>800km/week (one source claimed she did a few 300km rides in build). Many rides included big-gear intervals – e.g. 4×20min at 60rpm low Zone3. She often trained in windy, non-drafting conditions to simulate Kona feel. Run: moderate mileage (60-80km/week) but many off-bike runs of varying length. Brett rarely had her do super long runs; instead multiple runs including frequent bricks (like 30min off hard bike, or 2x/day short runs). She also did hill running for strength (she’s said some key sessions were 1h hilly trail runs building leg strength). Gym: She did heavy weight training earlier in career, but under Brett it was more bodyweight and circuit stuff – still, strength emphasis prevailed via swim/bike. Also, Brett’s influence: she sometimes didn’t do a full IM simulation before Kona – example, in 2018, until 8 weeks out her longest ride was 2h, focusing on intensity, then she did a short crash volume build[\[26\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=running%20which%20is%20good%20to,reduce%20injury%20risk). That contrarian taper (very late volume) helped her freshness. Mentally, she followed coach blindly (Brett said jump, she said how high) – one reason he cited he likes coaching women, because they trust the process[\[121\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,his%20success%20with%20female%20athletes)[\[134\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=He%20commented%20that%20they%20were,to%20a%20volume%20based%20approach).  
  **Success factors:** Daniela’s upbringing as a swimmer and previous Olympic tri career gave her background to absorb training. Under Brett, she unlocked a new level by tackling her weakness (heat – they did lots of sessions in Thai heat, or indoor trainer with no fan to adapt) and pushing her bike power up with strength training. Her mental strength is top-notch; known as “Angry Bird,” she channels pressures into focus. The high volume didn’t break her – genetically she’s robust and Brett adjusted on days she was flat (remember he runs day-to-day; if Dani was exhausted, he’d give easy day). She also thrived in a squad environment – training with others (Nicola Spirig earlier, etc.) kept it fun. The emphasis on strength meant by Kona, she was often way stronger – e.g. 2018 she blew field away on bike and still ran decently in brutal conditions.  
  **Non-transferable:** Daniela’s peak weeks \~40h training – no amateur can copy that. Also, few can handle such minimal taper; her body could keep doing big training close to race (even at 8 weeks out still no long ride done is unimaginable for most). Her blind trust in coach – amateurs don’t usually have a Brett telling them exactly “run now/hard now,” so trying to replicate that environment is impossible. And she has rare mental durability to suffer (she’s done entire rides on 60rpm – painfully grinding – which most would bail on).  
  **Transferable:** *Strength focus* – using paddles, low cadence, hills, etc., to build specific endurance. An age-grouper can incorporate low-gear hill repeats on bike or use paddles in swim sets to improve swim strength (with care to avoid shoulder injury). Also, reverse periodization elements: do some intensity in winter when long outdoor rides are hard – e.g. trainer intervals – then as weather improves, add volume (this suits many AG schedules). Daniela’s consistency is big – she hasn’t had major injury in her dominant years, likely due to not overrunning too long and focusing on quality (and possibly her diet/sleep discipline). So, *staying healthy to train* \> any single workout. Another one: *not over-fussing on gadgets.* She trained mostly by feel (some say she didn’t use powermeter in races until recently). Many AGers overanalyze; sometimes just training hard without overthinking yields great results, especially if it means you enjoy training more. Of course, one needs experience for that, but the general idea is to not be paralyzed by data. Daniela also emphasized cross-training variety: she’d MTB, XC ski in off-season – AGers can benefit from variety to stay fresh. Finally, *mental attitude*: she bounces back from bad races (like 2017 Kona failure led to 2018 domination) – amateurs should similarly not let one bad race define them, but use it as fuel.

* **Sam Laidlow** – *Aggressive Bike-Centric Strategy & Youthful Block Training*  
  **Coach:** His father, Richard Laidlow.  
  **Philosophy:** Sam is a newer star (2022 Kona 2nd, 2023 Nice IM World Champ) using a somewhat old-school approach – big training blocks, a lot of cycling (he grew up riding with Tour de France riders in Pyrenees), and a strategy to capitalize on the bike in races. The training is less conventional in structure, more about huge overload then recovery.  
  **Hallmarks:** Sam reportedly did some crazy blocks: e.g. a “cycling camp” where he rode 1000 km in a week with massive climbing (to boost bike strength). He also swam at high level as a youth (he can swim \~50min Ironman) so not much worry there except maintaining. His run historically weaker, so they hammered bike even more to get a lead (and it paid off in Kona 2022 – he biked a course record). His father’s approach as per interviews: consistent week structure, but heavy on volume for Sam as he’s young and resilient. In an Scientific Triathlon podcast, Richard Laidlow mentioned Sam’s week includes double sessions most days and \~30h volume in peak[\[135\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts403/#:~:text=,years%20to%20maintain%20this%20progression)[\[136\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts403/#:~:text=,under%2020%20hours%20per%20week). Sam’s *weekly structure* (from that interview): Mondays long swim \+ 2-4h bike; Tue brick (bike IM pace \+ short fast run VO₂ intervals)[\[137\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts403/#:~:text=%2A%20Tuesdays%3A%20A%20,due%20to%20his%20high%20sweat)[\[138\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts403/#:~:text=incorporates%20speed%20work%20such%20as,to%20his%20high%20sweat%20rate); Wed swim \+ long run with IM pace segments[\[139\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts403/#:~:text=and%20running.%20,to%20his%20high%20sweat%20rate); Thu long bike with hills (focus muscular endurance)[\[140\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts403/#:~:text=,hilly%20bike%20rides%2C%20employing%20Ironman)[\[141\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts403/#:~:text=upcoming%20Ironman%20World%20Championships%20in,training%20are%20continued%20to%20address); Fri swim technique \+ short run drills; Sat flat bike with IM intervals \+ stabilisation exercises[\[142\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts403/#:~:text=technique%20work%20requires%20focused%20effort,easy%20bike%20ride%20for%20recovery)[\[143\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts403/#:~:text=,easy%20bike%20ride%20for%20recovery); Sun swim endurance \+ threshold run \+ easy bike recovery[\[144\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts403/#:~:text=specific%20needs.%20,easy%20bike%20ride%20for%20recovery)[\[145\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts403/#:~:text=,easy%20bike%20ride%20for%20recovery). That’s a brutal load but he noted they adjust if Sam looks off[\[146\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts403/#:~:text=bike%20ride%20for%20recovery.%20,which%20is%20the%20key%20objective)[\[147\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts403/#:~:text=adhere%20to%20it,which%20is%20the%20key%20objective). Sam also did heat prep for Kona and Nice (sauna, training in south France summer). Sam’s *intensity distribution* likely pyramidal: 50-55% bike, 20-25% run, 20% swim by time, and within intensity, they said \~50% Z1, 45% Z2, 5% Z3+ in last year (semi-pyramidal)[\[148\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts403/#:~:text=,approach%20to%20his%20training%20program)[\[149\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts403/#:~:text=weekly.%20,approach%20to%20his%20training%20program). They emphasise pushing LT1 up close to LT2 (i.e. make his endurance pace faster)[\[150\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts403/#:~:text=,the%20Ironman%20distance%20event%20itself)[\[151\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts403/#:~:text=,and%20engaging%20smaller%20muscle%20groups) – hence lots of Ironman-specific training, not much pure VO₂max. Strength: Sam does lots of proprioception/stability training (his coach said they focus on tendon/ligament strength to ensure he can handle big loads)[\[152\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts403/#:~:text=Ironman%20distance.%20,methodology%20involves%20identifying%20the%20weakest)[\[153\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts403/#:~:text=our%20focus%20is%20primarily%20on,methodology%20involves%20identifying%20the%20weakest).  
  **Why it works:** Sam grew up essentially doing triathlons since a boy (home-schooled to focus on sport), so by 24 he had 10+ years of base. That let him handle huge loads early. His physiology is naturally high-power – he can push 300+W for hours, which combined with aero gains (he’s 6’2” but works on aero) makes him deadly on bike. He also isn’t afraid to hurt himself – evidence: in Nice 2023, he attacked on bike early and hung on grimly on run for win. The training blocks with high volume gave him confidence to sustain such moves. Also, having dad as coach means very personalised oversight – they adjust daily if needed, something amateurs rarely get unless self-coached full-time. Sam’s environment (training partners, support in tri-community at home) helps keep training quality high.  
  **Non-transferable:** His volume at young age – risky for others to mimic without that childhood build-up. Also his aggressive race style could backfire (and did, until it worked) – amateurs trying to “go off the front” in their race often explode. Also, being 24-25, he recovers faster than an older athlete – a 40-year-old amateur must approach training with more caution. The heavy family involvement – not everyone has a dedicated coach parent keeping them accountable daily.  
  **Transferable:** *Focus on your strength.* Sam knew his bike was gold, so he leaned into it. For an amateur who’s e.g. a great cyclist, using that advantage (perhaps by training to maximize it and planning race strategy around it) can be smart – as long as run doesn’t fall apart. Conversely, if bike is weakness, focus there. Also, Sam’s team emphasises **stability and injury prevention** – doing those “boring” small-muscle exercises (balance, core, ankle stability)[\[152\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts403/#:~:text=Ironman%20distance.%20,methodology%20involves%20identifying%20the%20weakest) – that’s something any amateur can and should do to handle training load better. Another thing: Sam integrates fun like group rides, and he does extreme challenges which keep him motivated. While amateurs shouldn’t overdo, throwing in a big challenge (like a long sportive or training camp) can boost fitness and motivation. And a simple yet key takeaway: *family/support system*. Sam’s success is partly due to family backing – amateurs can benefit from involving family in the journey (for support with schedule, etc., or even training together if possible). If not family, a coach or club can replicate that support network.

*(This mapping shows that each champion leverages a specific approach suited to their strengths/background. For our mid-level athlete, it’s crucial to extract the principles that apply without blindly copying the pros’ volume or extreme sessions. Now, we dive deeper into the currently famed Norwegian method, as asked, to distill how an amateur might carefully adopt pieces of it.)*

## Norwegian Method Deep Dive (Kristian Blummenfelt’s Approach for Amateurs)

The “Norwegian Method” has gained renown thanks to Blummenfelt & Iden dominating Olympic, 70.3, and Ironman races. It combines scientific rigor with a heavy training load. Let’s break it down:

**Origins & Coaching Team:** The approach has roots in Norwegian endurance coaching for track athletes in the 90s[\[154\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Way%20back%20in%201998%2C%20the,%E2%80%9D). Olav Aleksander Bu (sports scientist) and Arild Tveiten (head coach) adapted it for triathlon. Marius Bakken (Norwegian runner) documented the lactate-threshold model which became central[\[154\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Way%20back%20in%201998%2C%20the,%E2%80%9D)[\[155\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=to%20monitor%20and%20control%20running,%E2%80%9D). In triathlon, under coach Tveiten, they applied these principles plus integrated modern tech (lactate meters, glucose sensors, etc.). Olav Bu, an engineer, further optimized it – e.g. devising protocols for double threshold days and data analytics on the athletes. So it’s a coach team blending sports science and practical know-how.

**Core Principles:** \- **High Volume, Low Intensity Base:** The Norwegians train a lot (30h/week for Kristian, \~1100 annual hours). 80–90% of sessions are low intensity (Zone1 easy)[\[8\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=High,as%20high%20as%20you%20think)[\[1\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=ADVERTISEMENT). This is similar to a pyramidal distribution – lots of easy aerobic work to build capacity. They just do more of it than almost anyone. \- **Threshold Training Precision:** A hallmark is doing many workouts at just below or around LT2 (anaerobic threshold), measured by lactate \~3–4 mmol[\[5\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20easy%2C%20medium%2C%20and%20hard,LT2%29%E2%80%9D)[\[54\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=LT1%20%28,again%2C%20these%20numbers%20can%20vary). They call these “threshold” but many would term them *upper tempo* (around 1-hour race pace). For them it’s around Zone3 in a 5-zone model[\[6\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Image%3A%20Norwegian%20Method%20Zones). By carefully keeping intensity controlled (often by stopping to take lactate samples mid-interval), they maximize time in that productive zone without tipping into anaerobic stress. The logic: just below LT2, you get near-maximal aerobic stimulus but can accumulate volume since fatigue is lower than if you go above LT2[\[58\]\[156\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,are%20actually%20training%20at%20threshold). \- **Double Threshold Days:** Once or twice a week, they do two hard sessions in one day[\[53\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=High,infamous%20aspect%20of%20the%20Norwegian). For example, AM run intervals at threshold, PM bike intervals at threshold. Why? It “blocks” a lot of intensity into one day, creating a big stimulus, then they recover on following day(s). This clustering allows high-intensity volume but with sufficient recovery after. There’s evidence that two shorter threshold sessions separated by hours may be gentler on body than one monster session – plus you get two stimuli for adaptation[\[100\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Double%20threshold%20days%20As%20simple,at%20precisely%20the%20correct%20intensity). \- **Lactate & Monitoring:** They rely on lactate measurements during key workouts[\[55\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=intensity%20might%20not%20be%20as,at%20precisely%20the%20correct%20intensity). Each athlete knows their LT1 and LT2 lactate values (for Blum \~0.8-1 mmol at LT1, \~3-4 at LT2, just as example). By measuring, they ensure, say, threshold reps yield \~3 mmol; if higher, they back off intensity[\[57\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=At%20the%20end%20of%20a,are%20actually%20training%20at%20threshold)[\[58\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,are%20actually%20training%20at%20threshold). They also track HR, glucose, core temp, etc., but lactate is central as the gauge of intensity on the day. \- **Intensity Discipline (no “hard-outs”):** They avoid going above prescribed intensity. E.g., their VO₂max intervals (Zone4/5) are also often controlled by lactate \~5-6 mmol for “hard” and \~8+ for “very hard” – seldom truly all-out. They save 100% efforts for races. This way they can repeat quality sessions frequently without burnout[\[59\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Examples%3A)[\[60\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=The%20same%20principles%20apply%20to,free%20environment). \- **Use of testing & tech:** Regular lab tests (VO₂max, lactate profile) to update zones. They also do heat adaptation scientifically, altitude blocks with data, etc. Basically, a very evidence-driven program. But at its heart, it’s about lots of volume and lots of threshold.

**Typical Training Structure:** \- *Daily Rhythm:* They often train 3–4 sessions a day: e.g. morning hard session, mid-day easy, afternoon/evening second hard on key days[\[53\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=High,infamous%20aspect%20of%20the%20Norwegian). Other days are 2-3 easy sessions. For example: \- Mon: easy (e.g. recovery swim \+ easy run); \- Tue: AM threshold intervals (bike), PM threshold intervals (run); \- Wed: easy long aerobic sessions (e.g. 5h ride); \- Thu: AM threshold (run), PM threshold (bike or swim); \- Fri: easy (maybe technique swim \+ short jog); \- Sat: long bricks or tempo (they might do some 70.3 pace stuff here, which for them is still below LT2, but steady long efforts); \- Sun: long run easy. This is not exact but aligns with known info (they’ve shown glimpses on Strava etc., plus Triathlete magazine’s deep dives). \- *Intensity Distribution:* Roughly pyramidal. One analysis suggested Blum’s time was \~50% Z1, 40% Z2 (which for them is below LT1? depends how defined), 10% Z3+, but by sessions it was 80% easy sessions[\[1\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=ADVERTISEMENT). The key is they do a lot of “medium” which others avoid. Norwegian coach Alan Couzens said “they do a lot in the middle”[\[5\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20easy%2C%20medium%2C%20and%20hard,LT2%29%E2%80%9D)[\[54\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=LT1%20%28,again%2C%20these%20numbers%20can%20vary). \- *Recovery emphasis:* Because training is brutal, they prioritize recovery: lots of calories (they fuel during workouts heavily – e.g. 100g carb/hour even in threshold sessions), sleep (they often nap mid-day), and techniques like compression, etc. They rarely compromise sleep for training – if anything, they might start sessions later to get enough rest.

**Use of Lactate & Testing:** \- They measure lactate during *threshold sessions nearly every interval*. For example, Blum’s 6×6min run might look like: run 6min at \~3:00/km, stop 15s, prick finger, measure \~3.2 mmol \-\> “okay good, continue.” If it read, say, 5 mmol, they know he’s crossed LT2 – he’d adjust next rep slower or call it. \- Field testing: They did a famous test where Blum ran 10km on track, pricking every 1km – to see how lactate changed, validating his threshold pace. \- They also do regular ramp tests on bike to determine power at LT1 (approx 2 mmol) and LT2 (approx 4 mmol) which set his training zones precisely. \- Bu has said they use lactate over HR because HR can drift and vary; lactate is a direct marker of metabolic intensity. But for amateurs, note: lactate meters are pricey and require practice to use reliably. \- They also wear CGM (glucose monitors) to ensure fueling is on point, and aero test often in wind tunnel, leaving nothing to chance.

**Strengths of Approach:** \- Elevates the athlete’s “cruise” speed tremendously. By doing so much threshold, their LT2 moves up – meaning they can hold a higher fraction of VO₂max for long durations. This is key to long-course racing. It basically expands their Zone2/3 such that Ironman pace feels relatively easy. \- Highly *predictable performance*: all that data means on race day they know “I can hold X pace at Y HR because I’ve done it in training with controlled lactate.” So pacing execution is superb. \- Avoids the extremes: little chance of overtraining via HIIT because they seldom do killer anaerobic work. Also less injury risk than doing a ton of pure speed, since threshold running is fast but not sprinting (still, it’s strenuous, hence careful volume management is needed). \- Works amazingly at pro volume – Blum/Iden recover well enough to handle two hard sessions next day because they never truly spiked beyond threshold.

**Risks and Failure Modes:** \- **Monotony & Mental Fatigue:** As Blum said in interviews, training can be “boring” – so much controlled work, indoor sessions to avoid distractions[\[63\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=The%20high,best%20endurance%20athletes%20in%20history). Not all athletes (especially amateurs with no podium goals) can tolerate that lack of variety or spontaneity. Some could lose enjoyment, which threatens consistency. \- **High Volume Requirement:** The method’s success is partly volume synergy – doing threshold within a large volume base. If an amateur tries threshold-heavy on low volume (say 6h/week with 3 threshold workouts), they could burn out – they don’t have the easy aerobic support nor recovery time (job, etc.) to buffer it[\[4\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Clearly%2C%20the%20Norwegian%20Method%20is,professional%20support%20systems%20behind%20them)[\[157\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=An%20amateur%20triathlete%20with%20eight,with%20unlimited%20weekly%20training%20time). It’s explicitly noted: amateurs with only 8h/week might not benefit as much, better to use that time for some higher intensity and moderate – ironically, opposite approach as needed for pros[\[157\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=An%20amateur%20triathlete%20with%20eight,with%20unlimited%20weekly%20training%20time)[\[158\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Triathletes%20with%20limited%20training%20time,kids%2C%20and%20other%20daily%20obligations). \- **Injury Risk:** Two-a-day hard sessions are a strain. Without careful monitoring, an amateur could accumulate tendon or joint stress (especially running threshold miles – it’s fast running). If they don’t adjust for not having pro physio, they may get injured. \- **Lack of High-End Gear:** Norwegians can still go fast because their VO₂max is naturally high and maintained by threshold work to an extent, but some argue if you do no \>LT2 work, you might plateau in VO₂max eventually. They do occasional VO₂ blocks (e.g. 1-2 times a year a couple weeks of harder stuff). For amateurs focusing only on threshold, they might miss the benefits of some true speedwork or neuromuscular gains of sprinting. \- **Overtraining if mis-executed:** The fine line is crucial – go a bit too hard regularly (turn threshold into supra-threshold) and you accumulate fatigue much like HIIT but insidiously. Lionel Sanders tried to copy them initially and found it exhausting; he had to adjust intensities down significantly to match lactate targets, learning he was overcooking all “threshold” efforts previously[\[126\]](https://forum.slowtwitch.com/t/what-is-the-norwegian-triathlon-training-bible/815399#:~:text=Lionel%20Sanders%20summarised%20the%20NOR,That%27s%20pretty%20much%20it).

**Why it works at Elite Level:** \- Elites have the base mileage and lifestyle to maximize it. They can eat, sleep, train repeat – necessary to handle the volume of threshold. Also, elites often have similar physiology cluster that responds to threshold – historically, many Norwegian sports (XC skiing, etc.) utilized threshold training successfully for those with big aerobic engines, so it’s somewhat proven at top end. \- They often have sports science support – daily lactate measurement, etc. which ensures near-perfect intensity control. That feedback loop means the training stays in the “sweet spot” of hard-but-not-too-hard which might be narrower window than it seems. \- At elites, the competition requires pushing thresholds up – they’re near their VO₂max limits, so raising threshold yields more benefit than trying to raise VO₂max a few points with brutal VO₂ intervals which also cost more recovery. For long-course (Ironman), threshold training specifically raises the power/pace they can sustain in race, directly improving performance.

**Adapting for a Mid-Level Amateur:** \- **Reduce Intensity Frequency:** Instead of double threshold twice a week (4 hard sessions), an amateur might do 2–3 threshold sessions total per week (maybe one double day). For example, one could do Tue AM bike threshold, Tue PM easy (skip double threshold early on), Thu run threshold, rest others. Or do one single threshold day for run, one for bike a week. That’s still plenty. Olav Bu even said age-groupers can channel the “essence” without lactate meter: e.g. do 1 threshold workout per sport per week at controlled effort, ensure rest around it[\[159\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=deliver%20the%20Norwegian%20Method%20to,everyday%20triathletes)[\[3\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=The%20training%20methods%20we%E2%80%99ll%20discuss,to%20avoid%20injury%20and%20burnout). \- **Monitor by HR/RPE if no lactate:** Use known threshold HR or talk test (e.g. a hard but controlled effort – 8/10 RPE, not 10/10). Over time, use a 30min time-trial to estimate threshold pace/power and aim for that in intervals. It’s not as precise but decent. Keep ego checked – if you feel great, *don’t* turn it into a VO₂ max workout; save that for the plan if any. \- **Lower Volume (smartly):** With \~10h/week, one might allocate \~2h to threshold work (20%) and 8h to low intensity (80%), which is somewhat still 80/20 by time (though threshold isn’t “high-intensity” but we’ll count it as quality time). That could be e.g. 2x bike interval sessions of 30min work each (1h total with rests), and 1x run threshold 30min work (plus warmup/cool). Then 7–8h of easy long ride, runs, etc. This is heavy but doable for a strong amateur. \- **Ensure Recovery & Nutrition:** Adopting even part of this method means fueling workouts (carry carbs on all \>1h sessions), prioritizing sleep, and possibly cutting other life stress if possible on hard training blocks. Also, plan recovery weeks periodically. Norwegians don’t explicitly periodize big rest weeks (they more micro-manage day to day), but amateurs probably should every 3–4 weeks back off intensity to consolidate. \- **Elements to Adopt Safely:** \- Do threshold *intervals* instead of continuous at first (e.g. 4×10’ rather than 40’ continuous) – easier to maintain control and good form, and you can stop if HR/pace drifts too high. \- Use cross-training for some easy volume to protect legs (e.g. extra easy bike instead of run if doing a lot of run threshold). \- Use a lactate-like proxy: for instance, if using HR, note your known threshold HR from a race or test. In training, ensure threshold intervals HR doesn’t overshoot that after initial build-up. If it does, ease off slightly. Or if using RPE/pace: if pace starts to fade or it feels above an 8/10 effort, back off. \- Strict easy days: adopt the philosophy that *easy means truly easy*. Norwegians often keep easy runs \<1.8 mMol lactate (pretty low) – practically, that could mean very slow jog or walk breaks. For you, make easy sessions almost embarrassingly slow so you’re fresh for hard days. \- Limit double threshold days until you’ve acclimated to single sessions – maybe try one day where you do AM/PM smaller workouts. E.g. AM: 4×5’ threshold run, PM: 3×10’ threshold bike. See how you handle next 2 days. If exhaustion hits, extend recovery days.

**Elements to Avoid or Heavily Modify:** \- Don’t jump into 6 days/week threshold like Blum. Also, skip lactate testing mid-run unless you invest properly – doing it wrong could mislead (and finger pricking mid-run is impractical solo). Instead, use it periodically after intervals to spot-check if you have the device, but it’s optional. \- Avoid too high intensity in the name of threshold. It’s easy to start chasing paces and accidentally do supra-threshold. Without expert oversight, an amateur might creep into Zone4 each rep. Better to err slightly low – even if you train at 90% LT rather than 100%, you’ll still get a lot of benefit with less risk. \- Double days: If you do them, ensure the following day is very light or off. Pros can sometimes do threshold two days in a row; amateurs should not. \- Also avoid neglecting top-end and fun entirely – an amateur might incorporate a bit more variety (maybe occasional group ride or 5k race) for sanity, whereas Norwegians might avoid unscheduled hard efforts. Just be mindful to treat those as beyond the plan and recover.

In summary, a mid-level amateur can *borrow the Norwegian method’s main ideas*: lots of training around threshold intensity, careful intensity control (maybe via HR/power zones), and a high ratio of easy training to support it. But they should do so at a scaled volume and frequency, and monitor recovery closely. If done right, they can improve lactate threshold (meaning hold higher power at lower lactate in races) which directly benefits a hilly Ironman by improving sustainable pacing on climbs and fast flats without blowing up.

Finally, one should remember Bu’s statement: the “secret” of Norwegian method beyond lactate & double intervals is **consistency and a bit of fun** – those guys keep it *relaxed mentally* despite serious training[\[160\]](https://run.outsideonline.com/training/norwegian-method-secret/?scope=anon#:~:text=Triathletes%20are%20notoriously%20uptight%20and,with%20a%20few%20loose%20screws)[\[161\]](https://run.outsideonline.com/training/norwegian-method-secret/?scope=anon#:~:text=The%20Norwegians%20bring%20a%20seldom,%E2%80%9D). They joke, enjoy the process (Iden & Blum trash-talk each other, play games with tech)[\[162\]](https://run.outsideonline.com/training/norwegian-method-secret/?scope=anon#:~:text=So%20I%20was%20a%20bit,talking%20each%20other%20on%20camera)[\[161\]](https://run.outsideonline.com/training/norwegian-method-secret/?scope=anon#:~:text=The%20Norwegians%20bring%20a%20seldom,%E2%80%9D). So amateurs adopting it should also keep a good spirit to avoid staleness – do it in a squad or with music or whatever makes it enjoyable, because doing months of threshold alone can be tough.

## Consistency Rules by Philosophy

To ensure an Ironman training plan stays coherent and yields results, each philosophy has guiding “rules.” Breaking these tends to sabotage the plan. Here are explicit rules for each major philosophy:

* **Traditional High-Volume Base – Consistency Rules:**

* **Zone1/2 at least 80% of training**: All base miles should feel easy/moderate. If you’re breathing heavy on a base ride/run, you’re going too hard[\[15\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=If%20we%20look%20at%20the,between%206%20to%209%20weeks)[\[16\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=Firstly%2C%20after%20the%20long%20base,the%20core%20of%20our%20sport). Keep long sessions strictly aerobic (use talk test or HR cap).

* **No more than 1–2 hard sessions/week initially**: During base, “hard” might just be a short tempo. Don’t introduce intervals every day. Once build starts, limit quality to \~2–3 workouts/week spaced out (e.g. Tue/Thu/Sat)[\[110\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/essential-run-advice-coach-brett-sutton/?scope=anon#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20essential%20run%20workouts%20age,four%20workouts%20that%20are%20essential)[\[111\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/essential-run-advice-coach-brett-sutton/?scope=anon#:~:text=a,done%20at%20a%20conversational%20pace).

* **Hard qualifies as \> Zone3**: Count any effort at threshold or above as a hard session. Even if it’s a group ride surge or a local 5k race – it takes a recovery toll, so treat it as one of your week’s hard sessions (not an extra) or you risk breaking the volume+intensity balance.

* **Long Ride weekly; Long Run weekly**: Aim for one ride building to 5-6h and one run to 2.5-3h (for advanced) or 2h (for most amateurs) each week or in a 10-day cycle. These are cornerstones for endurance[\[110\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/essential-run-advice-coach-brett-sutton/?scope=anon#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20essential%20run%20workouts%20age,four%20workouts%20that%20are%20essential). If you must skip due to life, reschedule rather than scrap it entirely, but don’t double up next week – just continue plan.

* **Add Volume before Intensity**: If plateauing early, extend some workouts rather than upping intensity. E.g. go from 4 runs/week of 30k total to 4 runs 40k total by making them longer, *not* faster, until you hit your available time max. Only then consider adding intensity.

* **Recovery Weeks \~Every 4th Week**: Plan an easier week (volume cut \~20-30%, intensity minimal) every 3rd or 4th week[\[82\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=to%20incorporate%20faster%20work%20with,with%20the%20traditional%20method%20begin)[\[163\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=periods%2C%20aerobic%20function%20is%20depleted,the%20core%20of%20our%20sport). This prevents cumulative fatigue given the high volume.

* **Don’t neglect nutrition/rest**: Long base training depletes energy. Eat enough (especially carbs around workouts) and sleep \>7–8h. These aren’t optional in high-volume plans – underfueling or lack of sleep leads to illness/injury, breaking consistency.

* **Common mistakes to avoid:** Pushing the easy days too hard (“gray zone” every day) – leads to constant medium fatigue and no quality adaptation[\[39\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,without%20doing%20VO2%20max%20work). Also ramping volume too quickly – follow 5-10% weekly increases rule of thumb to avoid overuse. And doing hard intervals without base – e.g. a track workout in week1 is a no-no; wait until base is laid.

* **Reverse Periodization (Brett Sutton style) – Consistency Rules:**

* **Quality first, Quantity second:** In the initial phase, prioritize hitting the intensity targets, not accumulating hours[\[9\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,volume%20closer%20to%20race%20season). E.g. if schedule tight, better to complete the interval set and skip the extra easy miles than vice versa. Later, when shifting to volume, flip that priority.

* **90-95% Max Effort Limit:** No workout should be a true all-out max sprint[\[14\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=How%20could%20you%20possibly%20advocate,work%20without%20a%20base). All high-intensity is done at \~9/10 effort or less. This rule protects against injury and allows frequent repetition (e.g. track repeats at 90% speed). If you go 100% (say a dead sprint), you violate the approach – risk injury and add too much fatigue for next day.

* **Never two hard days in a row initially:** In the intensity block, follow each speed day with at least one easy or off day[\[21\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=We%20begin%20our%20year%20as,Many%20have%20asked%20me)[\[164\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=the%20program,Many%20have%20asked%20me). Eg. do swim sprints Monday, ensure Tuesday is low intensity before any Wednesday hard bike. As volume increases later, you might do back-to-back long aerobic days, but avoid back-to-back intensity until possibly final race bricks (even then, Brett tends to alternate heavy & light days).

* **Maintain “aerobic cup” to brim near race:** As you approach final 2–3 weeks pre-taper, ensure you complete the big aerobic sessions (long bricks, etc.) – that’s filling the aerobic cup[\[20\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=race%20lasts%201%20hour,overdoing%20speed%20work%20is%20negligent)[\[165\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=Just%20as%20it%20negligent%20to,we%20can%20to%20the%20race). It might mean reducing intensity during those weeks (since focus shifts). The rule is: do not compromise the last big aerobic block with extra speed sessions. If in doubt, drop a speed workout to not miss a long ride or brick.

* **Cut speedwork 2–3 weeks out:** Brett’s rule: no high-intensity intervals in final race prep weeks – they shift to race-pace and aerobic work[\[20\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/using-reverse-periodisation-for-triathlon#:~:text=race%20lasts%201%20hour,overdoing%20speed%20work%20is%20negligent). So around 3 weeks out, eliminate track repeats or heavy VO₂max rides – focus on long race-pace efforts and then taper. Breaking this (doing hard intervals in final week) could leave you flat or sore by race.

* **Heed recovery signals daily:** The program can be brutal; if you’re excessively fatigued or HR is elevated 10+ bpm in morning, take an unscheduled easy day. Brett’s method is flexible – pushing through deep fatigue breaks athletes[\[27\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=We%20now%20know%20it%20does,when%20the%20coach%20sees%20fit). So adapt: better to skip a session than train through injury onset or extreme fatigue.

* **Hard means any supra-threshold or very taxing session:** Could be short hill sprints, tempo bricks, etc. Limit to at most 3 hard sessions/week even in speed phase; 2 is often enough. In volume phase, maybe only 1 if any. This avoids burnout.

* **Don’t “race” workouts too early:** Brett often had to rein in athletes from trying to hit race goals in training. In reverse periodization, trust that aerobic fitness will come later; don’t for instance try a full IM simulation when you’re still in speed phase – that breaks the protocol (you’d just get fatigued without enough base yet).

* **Common mistakes:** Extending intensity phase too long (leads to stagnation) – adhere to plan to switch to endurance after \~6-8 weeks. Also, not adding enough volume later (some love the speed phase and forget to do sufficient long rides; result: great 10k shape but poor Ironman endurance). And ignoring technique because focus is on strength – still maintain form in swim (Brett does drills like “no kick” but not sloppy form). Finally, ego in workouts: because intensity starts high, athletes may chase PBs in training – e.g. doing 100% sprints – that violates the 90% rule and invites trouble.

* **Polarized 80/20 – Consistency Rules:**

* **Keep Easy truly Easy (\<= Zone1)**: Roughly 80% of sessions or time must be spent under first lactate threshold (LT1)[\[33\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,zones)[\[166\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=middle%20zone.%20,without%20doing%20VO2%20max%20work). Use methods to ensure this: conversational pace, HR below \~75% max, power below \~65% FTP. If you finish an “easy” session somewhat tired, you likely went too hard – dial back next time.

* **Hard Sessions are HARD but limited:** The other \~20% of time can be high intensity (Zone3 in 3-zone model)[\[31\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=Zone%203%20is%20above%20second,been%20on%20cross%20country%20skiiers). These sessions (interval workouts) should be very taxing (e.g. VO₂max effort), but you do only 2-3 per week max. And never back-to-back days with high intensity (especially not in 3 sports back-to-back) – alternate easy days between. If you feel you can do 5 HIIT sessions a week, you’re either superhuman or not going hard enough in them. Quality over quantity for intensity.

* **What qualifies as “hard”:** Generally, work above \~90% HRmax or RPE 9-10. Long tempo doesn’t count in pure polarized (that would be a break in protocol). So e.g. sweet spot ride at 88% FTP for 30min is not an “easy” or “hard” – it’s that grey zone which ideally you avoid except maybe minimal. So either you classify it as hard (thus limiting how often you do it) or better skip it. Sticking to either \<LT1 or around VO₂max is the ideology. Practically, if you do race-pace (IM pace) bricks, treat that as moderate – small amounts are fine but don’t let it erode the 80/20 too much[\[88\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=For%20longer%20distance%20triathlon%20which,best%20combination%20is%20for%20you).

* **Monitor Training Distribution:** Use a log to ensure you’re close to 80/20 by whatever metric (time or sessions)[\[167\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=how%20we%20define%2080%2F20%20and,of%20VO2)[\[168\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=Once%20you%20go%20over%20LT2,terms%20of%20VO2%20max%20development). If one week you see too many moderate efforts sneaking in (e.g. group rides that ended up tempo), adjust the next week to compensate with more easy time. Without tracking, many athletes inadvertently do 50/50 distribution – check yourself.

* **Recovery built-in via easy days:** If you stick to true easy on most days, you may not need full rest weeks as often. But generally still plan periodic lighter weeks if accumulated volume or intensity creeps up. Listen to your body – if even easy pace feels hard, take a day off (common sign of needing recovery in polarized model).

* **No moderate “junk miles”**: Avoid the trap of moderate pace in every session because it feels productive. If it’s not a designated intensity day, resist pushing. Zone1 rides/runs might feel “too slow” but that’s the discipline. A common rule: if unsure, go slower – it almost can’t be too slow on easy days (even brisk walking is acceptable cross-training).

* **Space High-Intensity sessions:** Ideally 48 hours apart for same sport. Eg. if you do a hard run Tue, next hard run not until Thu or Fri. You can do hard bike one day and hard run next if needed as they stress different muscles, but usually it’s better to give at least one day recovery between hard sessions of any type[\[40\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,without%20doing%20VO2%20max%20work)[\[169\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=Working%20one%20system%20will%20have,you%27ll%20likely%20have%20decent%20results).

* **Include some long easy workouts:** Particularly for Ironman, ensure one long ride and run are in the easy bin. They might be Zone2 at times which technically edges moderate, but polarized accepts some Zone2 especially for long course[\[47\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=time%20at%20a%20higher%20intensity,is%20likely%20to%20be%20beneficial). Just don’t turn long run into a race-pace run (that would become a hard session).

* **Common Mistakes:** Pushing the “20” to 30 or 40 – thinking more intensity \= more gain. Often results in burnout in a few weeks[\[170\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,is%20quite%20different%20to%20triathlon)[\[39\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,without%20doing%20VO2%20max%20work). Also, counting moderate as easy – e.g. doing all rides at high Zone2 (mis-classifying them as easy) – breaks the polarized stimulus (you accumulate too much fatigue to go truly hard on intensity days, and not enough stimulus on easy days to justify the fatigue). Another is impatience: polarized gains can come slower but are solid – don’t abandon after 3 weeks because you don’t feel faster; it can take 8-12 weeks to see big shifts. And not adjusting 80/20 for time constraints – as mentioned, if only 6h/week to train, strict 80/20 might under-dose intensity; you might do 70/30 by time in that case (just as an adjustment). The key rule is separation of intensity, not obsessing exact ratio[\[171\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,of%20VO2)[\[167\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=how%20we%20define%2080%2F20%20and,of%20VO2) – don’t do middle grind.

* **Pyramidal / Specific Endurance – Consistency Rules:**

* **Hit Each Intensity Zone Weekly:** Aim to get some training in low, some in moderate, and some in high intensities regularly[\[42\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873141/#:~:text=,triathletes%20in%20the%20three%20segments). E.g. within a 10-day microcycle ensure you have purely easy sessions, a couple moderate (tempo/SS), and one high (threshold/VO₂). This balance ensures all energy systems are in play. If you find you did only tempo all week, insert an easier day and a faster day next week.

* **Cap Hard Sessions \~3/week:** This includes moderate-hard (tempo) as “hard” in the sense of needing recovery. E.g. you might do 2 tempo and 1 interval session a week – that’s 3 quality sessions. The rest is base. Don’t do 5 moderate sessions thinking “they’re not high-intensity” – multiple Zone3 days in a row will accumulate fatigue similarly. Rule: at most 3 days in a week should leave you notably tired; the others should be more refreshing or steady.

* **Quality Defined by Purpose:** Each key workout has a clear focus: e.g. Tue threshold bike, Thu tempo run, Sat race-pace brick. Stick to the intended intensity in each – e.g. on tempo run day, don’t accidentally push to threshold; on easy days, don’t push to tempo. *Execute workout targets*. This avoids blurring into too much moderate or too much intensity.

* **Long Workouts often include some moderate:** This philosophy expects incorporating moderate intensity in long sessions (like IM pace efforts)[\[92\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,is%20that%20it%20is%20pyramidal). So plan those specifically (e.g. “on 4h ride, will do last 90min at IM wattage”). If you do a long session entirely easy occasionally fine, but regularly include some effort blocks to maximize specificity. Conversely, do not make every long session a race simulation – vary placement of moderate intensity (some at start, some at end, some evenly spaced) so you don’t overtrain but still practice.

* **Monitor Total Load (TSS or similar):** Pyramidal can be heavy because moderate intensity produces a lot of stress. Use metrics if possible to ensure you’re not spiking training load too fast. For example, track weekly TSS (Training Stress Score) or simple volume\*intensity factor. If it jumps by \>10-15% in a week, consider that a risk – hold or cut back next week.

* **Use Recovery Periods**: Include recovery weeks or lighter days after especially big specific blocks. E.g. after a training camp or very hard 3 weeks, take 4-5 days mostly easy to consolidate. Because pyramidal training tends to push threshold and moderate a lot, the body needs periodic backing off to adapt (some follow 2 hard weeks, 1 easy pattern).

* **No Prolonged Zone3 Every Day**: Avoid turning every session into a moderate one. A common trap: moderate feels productive and not too painful, so athletes drift there each day. The rule is: *moderate workouts are planned*; all other sessions should consciously be kept easier (Z1/Z2)[\[87\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=We%20compete%20for%20a%20longer,without%20doing%20VO2%20max%20work)[\[39\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,without%20doing%20VO2%20max%20work) or occasionally very hard (if scheduled).

* **Adjust Intensity by Phase:** Early base might be more low, little moderate. Build phase you ramp moderate and keep a bit of high. Peak phase, you might reduce high-intensity, focusing on moderate/race-pace (because too much high-intensity near race can cause unnecessary fatigue). Follow that periodization logic. E.g. 12 weeks out, threshold intervals each week; 3 weeks out, maybe threshold drops in favor of more time at IM pace. Not obeying this (doing VO₂ max close to race or doing none early when you had capacity) can hamper performance.

* **Common Mistakes:** Trying to do two types of quality in one day (like a tempo run morning, threshold bike evening) – yields too much fatigue, better separate days. Not fueling moderate sessions – these burn glycogen; if you don’t fuel, you can’t hit targets and risk catabolizing (carry gels even in training for long tempo rides). Also, skipping high-intensity entirely – some AGers do all tempo thinking that’s enough; but a bit of high-intensity can raise the ceiling so your tempo improves[\[172\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873141/#:~:text=Ironman%20distance%20triathlon,training%20intensity%20distribution%20regarding%20performance)[\[42\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873141/#:~:text=,triathletes%20in%20the%20three%20segments). On flip side, doing too much high-intensity such that moderate sessions suffer – pyramidal means moderate is the bread-and-butter; high-intensity is spice. If you’re smashed from too many intervals, you can’t perform the key tempo/IM pace bricks – thus not adhering to the philosophy’s emphasis on sub-threshold work.

Applying these consistency rules will help the athlete remain faithful to whichever philosophy they choose, ensuring the training plan forms a logical, effective progression rather than a mix of contradictory elements.

## Plan-Building Blueprints for Top 3 Philosophies

Now, we outline **blueprints for 17-week Ironman training plans** aligned with the 3 recommended philosophies (from the Executive Summary) for our athlete. Each blueprint covers the macrostructure (phases), weekly hour ranges, key workouts per phase, sample weekly schedule, hill and run progression strategies, and strength integration. The three plans are:

1. **Pyramidal Endurance Plan** (Aerobic Base \+ Specific Tempo) – a balanced plan suitable for Chris Dick’s durability and time (as a 34-year-old finance professional in Sevenoaks, UK).

2. **“Norwegian Lite” Threshold Plan** (Intensity disciplined plan) – incorporating threshold work with reduced volume.

3. **Sutton-Style Reverse Plan** (Early intensity, late volume with strength focus) – for an athlete who prefers variety and strength training emphasis.

The target race is August 16, 2026, with plan start April 16 (17 weeks out). We assume the athlete had some maintenance training before April but nothing structured, so we begin with a Base phase as needed.

### **1\) Pyramidal Endurance Plan (17 Weeks)**

**Overview:** This plan divides into Base (5 weeks), Build (8 weeks), Peak/Taper (4 weeks). It prioritizes aerobic base mileage and gradually adds tempo and threshold workouts. Weekly hours range \~10-12 in base, 12-16 in build, peaking 18h, then tapering down to \~8h final week. It suits the athlete’s available 8–16 hr/week schedule by averaging around 14 hr with a couple bigger weeks near peak (maybe one 18-20h camp week if possible).

**Phase Goals & Weekly Hours:** \- **Base Phase (Week 17–13 out; Apr 16 – May 20):** Goal \= Re-establish volume, improve fat metabolism and basic endurance, gently reintroduce moderate intensity. Weekly hours \~10 first week \-\> \~12 by end of base. Focus on frequency (e.g. 5 runs/week short \+ 1 long, 4 bikes including longer weekend, 3 swims). \- **Build Phase (Week 12–5 out; May 21 – July 7):** Goal \= Build aerobic power and muscular endurance; increase tempo/threshold work; raise long run/ride volume to near race needs. Hours \~12 in early build, peaking 15-16 mid-build, slight drop \~13-14 in later build to consolidate. Intensity: 1 threshold or VO₂max set per week, 1 tempo per sport per week, plus bricks. \- **Peak Specific Phase (Week 4–2 out; July 8 – July 21):** Goal \= Race-specific intensity and volume, then taper. A 2-week “overreach” block with high volume (\~16-18h) focusing on Ironman-pace efforts and long bricks, followed by start of taper. Last long brick around 3 weeks out. \- **Taper (Week 2–Race; July 22 – Aug 16):** Goal \= Recover fully while keeping sharpness. Hours \~12 two weeks out \-\> \~8 in race week (excluding race). Still include a bit of race-pace work to stay tuned but nothing exhausting.

**Key Workouts per Phase:** \- *Base:* Long ride (starting 3h, build to 5h by end of base); Long run (start 1.5h, build to 2h); Hill strides running (short 15s hill sprints 1x/week to maintain strength); Easy/moderate bricks (e.g. 3h ride \+ 20min run easy). Perhaps introduction of “Steady State” efforts: e.g. 2×10min at marathon pace in a run or 3×10min at 80% FTP in a ride just to begin engaging those systems[\[92\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,is%20that%20it%20is%20pyramidal). \- *Build:* Introduce weekly tempo runs (e.g. progression runs: 45min with last 20 at goal IM pace or half-IM pace) and threshold or VO₂ bike workouts (e.g. 4×8’ @ 100% FTP) early build[\[113\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,a%20decent%20pace%20at%20threshold)[\[81\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=He%20looked%20at%20what%20Lydiard,your%20ego%20at%20the%20door). Mid-build, add bricks with race-pace segments: e.g. 4h ride w/ 3×20’ at IM power \+ 45min run off bike at steady Z2 pace. Swim: add long endurance sets (e.g. 3×1000) and weekly threshold set (e.g. 15×100 on short rest). Hills: incorporate structured hill reps on bike 1×/2 weeks (5×5min climbing at near FTP) to improve climbing power. Running: do some downhill running practice in small doses to prep legs for eccentric load if course has descents (e.g. find a moderate hill, do 2-3 repeats of 5min down at easy pace focusing form). \- *Peak Specific:* Key brick: 5.5h ride (simulate Leeds hills) \+ 1h run at goal pace. Maybe do this 4 weeks out as a “simulation day” including nutrition practice[\[95\]](https://www.tri247.com/race-day-tips/half-ironman-middle-distance-triathlon-pacing-hills-fuelling-race-day-tips#:~:text=Stay%20focused%20on%20the%20downhills)[\[96\]](https://www.tri247.com/race-day-tips/half-ironman-middle-distance-triathlon-pacing-hills-fuelling-race-day-tips#:~:text=Use%20the%20downhills%20to%20recover,as%20much%20momentum%20as%20possible). Another: 3h ride with last 2h at IM effort (maybe on turbo to control) \+ 30min brick run moderate – big race-pace stimulus 2-3 weeks out. Swim: continuous 3800m TT in pool to build confidence (3 weeks out). Also one long run \~2.5h about 4 weeks out, mostly easy but last 30min at race pace effort (this is final long run). The second week of peak block might include a shorter brick at slightly above race pace (like a 100km ride at half-IM effort \+ 10km run at marathon pace) to boost fitness, then taper starts. \- *Taper:* Reduce volume but do short race-pace intervals: e.g. 3×10’ at IM power on bike 10 days out, or 2×1km at marathon pace on run 1 week out, just to keep feel. Rest day 2 days before race, short light workouts the day before (swim 15min with a few pickups, bike 20min easy, 10min jog easy).

**Sample Microcycle (Build Phase, \~15h week):** \- **Monday:** Swim 1hr (Recovery technique swim, e.g. 1500 easy \+ drills). Core strength 20’. *Note:* Monday as lighter/recovery day after weekend. \- **Tuesday:** AM: Bike 1.5hr with threshold intervals – e.g. 4×8min @ 100% FTP, 4min easy between[\[113\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,a%20decent%20pace%20at%20threshold). PM: Brick run 30min easy off bike. \- **Wednesday:** Run 1hr Z2 aerobic \+ 6×20s hill strides at end (full recovery between strides). Swim 1hr in PM (main set: 5×300 moderate on 30s rest). \- **Thursday:** Bike 4hr long ride (hilly route), include 3×15min at IM power on hills and practice eating every 15min[\[7\]\[7\]](https://www.tri247.com/race-day-tips/half-ironman-middle-distance-triathlon-pacing-hills-fuelling-race-day-tips#:~:text=On%20the%20climbs%2C%20try%20to,have%20a%20few%20pennies%20left). No run today (big ride focus). \- **Friday:** AM: Run tempo 1hr: 15min easy, 30min tempo (\~Zone3, e.g. build from marathon pace to half-marathon pace)[\[111\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/essential-run-advice-coach-brett-sutton/?scope=anon#:~:text=a,done%20at%20a%20conversational%20pace)[\[114\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/essential-run-advice-coach-brett-sutton/?scope=anon#:~:text=d,time%20to%20help%20with%20performance), 15min cool down. PM: Swim 1hr (threshold set: 10×200 at T-pace, 20s rest). \- **Saturday:** Brick: Bike 3hr including 2×20km at 70.3 effort (about Zone3) with 10min easy between; immediately run 45min steady (first 30 easy, last 15 at goal IM marathon pace). \- **Sunday:** Run 2hr long run easy (Zone1-2) on rolling terrain. Optional short 1hr recovery ride later if feeling stiff.

(*The above is a heavy mid-build week; easier weeks might cut the Thursday ride intensity and reduce Saturday volume.*)

**Hill Progression Strategy:** Starting in base, include hill sprints and low-cadence trainer intervals to build leg strength. By build phase mid-point, do long climb repeats (e.g. 3×10min climb at FTP in aero position[\[83\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,as%20it%20keeps%20your%20form)) to simulate Leeds hills. Also incorporate hills in long rides. For run, incorporate moderate hill runs (rolling courses) often, and possibly some hill repeats of 1-2min at threshold effort to build climbing muscles. Closer to race, ensure rides on similar terrain as Leeds to practice gearing and pacing on climbs and descents[\[173\]](https://www.tri247.com/race-day-tips/half-ironman-middle-distance-triathlon-pacing-hills-fuelling-race-day-tips#:~:text=TRI247%20www,reason%20being%20that%20a)[\[95\]](https://www.tri247.com/race-day-tips/half-ironman-middle-distance-triathlon-pacing-hills-fuelling-race-day-tips#:~:text=Stay%20focused%20on%20the%20downhills). The plan gradually extends length of hill intervals and bricks to handle cumulative fatigue of hills then running.

**Run Durability Strategy:** Emphasize frequency over huge single long runs to avoid injury. Run 4-5× per week with two semi-long runs (e.g. mid-week 60-75min, weekend long 2-2.5h). Use bricks to practice running on tired legs (almost every week). Late build, do one “big day” run simulation: e.g. swim 1hr, bike 3hr, then run \~2hr (broken as 1h morning, 1h afternoon if needed) to accumulate run fatigue similar to Ironman without single-session injury risk. Also incorporate soft surface runs to minimize impact (trail or grass for recovery runs). By taper, the athlete should have done a couple of 2.5h runs and numerous 1-1.5h off-bike runs (albeit some broken into bricks). If any soreness arises (e.g. shin pain), immediately replace runs with elliptical or deep water running for a few days to nip injuries – durability comes from consistent pain-free mileage.

**Minimal Effective Strength Integration:** Two short strength sessions a week, focusing on core, glutes, and injury prevention: e.g. 20min Mondays and 20min Thursdays. Key exercises: planks, side planks, single-leg deadlifts (light weight), step-ups or lunges (to aid hill power), calf raises (prevent Achilles issues from hill running), and band work for hips. Also include 10min of mobility (hip flexors, hamstrings, shoulders) on rest days. This is enough to support muscle stability without exhausting the athlete. As race nears, reduce strength to maintenance (once a week, lighter) to free energy for big training.

This pyramidal plan should suit the athlete by playing to their durability (lots of aerobic work) and targeting the race specifics (hills, pacing). It’s moderately complex but with variety to keep interest. It emphasizes consistency and gradual build so the athlete peaks at the right time with strong bike and resilient run.

### **2\) “Norwegian Lite” Threshold Plan (17 Weeks)**

**Overview:** This plan adapts the Norwegian model to \~12–14 hours/week. It emphasizes double threshold sessions weekly, high intensity control, and fewer total hours than pyramidal (since quality is higher). Volume is moderate, intensity relatively high but controlled. Structured in 3 phases: Base-conditioning (4 weeks), Threshold Build (10 weeks), Taper (3 weeks). It is riskier if not executed properly, so discipline is paramount. Suited for an analytical athlete who can measure HR/pace closely.

**Phase Goals & Weekly Hours:** \- **Base-Conditioning (Weeks 17–14; 4 weeks):** Goal \= prepare body for heavy threshold training by establishing modest volume and technique. Hours \~8 first week \-\> \~12 by week 4\. Include mostly easy training and some short pickups but no sustained threshold yet (perhaps a few strides or 1-2 short threshold intervals to calibrate). \- **Threshold Build Phase (Weeks 13–4; 10 weeks):** Goal \= raise lactate threshold pace/power across all three sports. Key is weekly (later twice weekly) threshold workouts in each sport, lots of Zone1 mileage around them. Possibly break into two blocks: first 6 weeks focusing thresholds, then 1 easier week, then final 3-week block including a bit of race-specific work. \- **Taper (Weeks 3–Race; 3 weeks):** Goal \= maintain threshold fitness while freshening up and adding race prep. Reduce training volume \~-30% 3 weeks out and another \~-30% race week. Keep some short threshold reps and add specific pace practice (esp. longer IM-pace bricks).

**Weekly Hours**: Peak around 14h in threshold build (due to many easy miles \+ intervals). If threshold sessions replace some volume, hours might not go above \~14. Base was \~10 avg, threshold build avg \~13, taper \~8-10.

**Key Workouts per Phase:** \- *Base:* Long easy sessions still included: ride up to 4h easy by week 4, run up to 1h45 easy. Technical focus: swim drills and ensuring good form at slower paces. Maybe test threshold baseline in week 4 (e.g. 20min all-out bike test or a lactate step test if available) to set training zones. Minor intensity: one short interval set per week to prime (like 5×3min at threshold with big rests). \- *Threshold Build:* Heart of plan. Weeks 13-10: do 2 days of threshold work per week (one focused on bike+swim, one on run+perhaps second swim): \- Example: Tue – AM bike threshold intervals (e.g. 4×10min at FTP, 2min rests), PM run threshold intervals (e.g. 5×1km at open 10k pace with 1min rests)[\[6\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/how-to-train-like-a-norwegian-without-the-blood/?scope=anon#:~:text=Image%3A%20Norwegian%20Method%20Zones)[\[57\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=At%20the%20end%20of%20a,are%20actually%20training%20at%20threshold). \- Friday – AM swim threshold set (10×200 at threshold pace), PM maybe an easy ride or off. Initially perhaps only one session per day; later can try double threshold day (morning and evening as above) if recovery seems fine. The rest of days are low intensity: e.g. Mon recovery swim+easy run, Wed mid-long ride easy, Thu easy run \+ swim technique, Sat long ride easy, Sun long run easy. As fitness improves, increase threshold session volume (like 6×10min bike, or run intervals total 6-7km instead of 5km). Weeks 9-7: Slightly adjust – possibly incorporate one VO₂max session to raise ceiling (like 5×3min 120% FTP one week on bike instead of threshold). But majority still threshold sets. Bricks: not emphasized early because threshold training itself is priority, but from week 8 start adding short bricks off an easy ride to get used to transition (e.g. Sat: 3h easy ride \+ 20min easy run). \- *Peak Specific (part of taper essentially weeks 3-4 out):* Now reduce threshold intensity slightly (fewer reps) and introduce race-pace bricks to ensure specificity. E.g. 4 weeks out: replace one threshold day with an IM pace brick – 4h ride at 75% FTP \+ 45min run at IM goal pace. Still do one threshold swim and one threshold run that week but volume of each cut by 30%. 2 weeks out: one short threshold swim (e.g. 5×100 fast), one threshold run (e.g. 3×1km) early in week, everything else IM pace or easy. \- *Taper Weeks:* Very little threshold, mostly short bursts to keep sharp. One key swim set 10 days out: 1500m at steady hard (race simulation effort). A mini race-pace brick 10 days out: 2h ride incl. 1h at IM wattage \+ 30min run at IM pace – just to reinforce pacing. Last 7 days, maybe 1×3min threshold on bike and 1×1km threshold run to remind body, rest is easy.

**Sample Microcycle (Threshold Build, \~13h):** \- **Monday:** Recovery. 45min swim easy \+ drills. 30min easy run (Z1) if feeling okay, otherwise off. *Focus on recovery from weekend.* \- **Tuesday:** **Double Threshold Day** – AM: Bike 1.25hr with 5×8min @ 95-100% FTP, 2min easy spin between. Aim lactate \~3-4 mM or HR at known threshold. Cool down well. Midday: 30min nap if possible. PM: Run 1hr with 4×1.5km at threshold pace (approx 10k race pace)[\[174\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,don%27t%20consider%20this%20in%20training), 90s jog rests, on flat path or track. Should feel hard but sustainable – cap HR at known LTHR. \- **Wednesday:** Swim 1hr endurance (e.g. 3×800m at steady Zone2 pace, 30s rest). Bike 2hr easy (Zone1-2), preferably flat or on trainer to avoid accidental intensity – keep HR \< 75% max. \- **Thursday:** Run 1.5hr easy (Zone1-2) on hilly route (a bit of stimulus but keep effort easy uphill). Include 6×15s strides on flat during last 15min to stay loose. 15min core and mobility after. \- **Friday:** **Threshold Day 2** – AM: Swim 1.25hr with threshold set: e.g. 15×100m @ \~1.30/100m (threshold pace) on 10s rest; try to hold pace consistent, check that last reps aren’t fading (if they are, stop at 12). PM: Bike 1hr recovery spin or off (depending on fatigue). Possibly do an easy 20min brick run after recovery spin to get some transition practice (Z1 jog). \- **Saturday:** Bike 4hr long ride endurance (Zone2 mostly). Include 2×20min at upper Zone2 / low Zone3 (around IM power) mid-ride to practice fueling at intensity. Keep remainder easy. Brick run off bike: 20min easy jog. \- **Sunday:** Run 2hr long run easy (Zone2). Aim for negative split (second half slightly faster, but still comfortable). If feeling good in last 20min, can creep to Zone3 (marathon effort) but not required. After run, 30min easy swim or aquajog (for recovery) if time.

(*This schedule puts 2 threshold days (Tue, Fri) with double workout on Tue. If recovery is tough, one can move Fri swim to Thu and have Fri off, adjusting as needed.*)

**Hill Progression:** This plan doesn’t prioritize hills as much in early build (focus is threshold intensity on controlled terrain). But to adapt to Leeds course, incorporate hills in easy sessions: Wednesday ride can be on rolling course but ensure power stays moderate (practicing shifting/cadence). Long rides on Saturday ideally on similar hilly terrain to build muscular endurance (just keep effort capped). In run, doing long runs on rolling terrain helps. After finishing major threshold block (say 6 weeks out), include a specific hill-focused workout: e.g. bike 5×5min hill repeats at threshold (like a threshold session but on hills for specificity). And a run hill session: 4 weeks out, 8×2min uphill at threshold effort with jog down – this builds confidence and strength for Leeds run. Essentially, once threshold fitness is built, you “translate” it to hills with a few targeted workouts near end. Also, practice descending: on some long runs include gentle downhill sections at race pace to condition quads (just moderate volume to avoid injury).

**Run Durability:** Because threshold training is heavy, run frequency might be 4x/week to allow recovery. Many runs are short but intensity is high on threshold days. To build durability, incorporate double runs occasionally: e.g. split 2hr long run into 1h morning \+ 1h evening if athlete often breaks down past 90min. That’s a known approach from Canova for amateurs. Also lean on low-impact cardio: if feeling beat, replace an easy run with elliptical or aqua jog to reduce pounding. Make sure threshold run intervals are mostly on flat (to avoid extra pounding of downhills). Monitor niggles – threshold running can cause calf or Achilles strain; integrate calf raises and foam rolling (strength). Off-bike runs are kept mostly short and easy – maybe lengthen a couple later (like a 40min brick at IM pace 5 weeks out) to ensure legs know the feeling. The overall strategy is quality \> quantity in runs: fewer miles but at strong stimulus, plus sufficient recovery. By race, their threshold run speed is higher, theoretically making IM pace feel easier. They might not have done as many mega-long runs, but threshold model’s bet is that huge volume isn’t needed if threshold and volume at low-intensity support it.

**Minimal Strength Integration:** Focus on prehab to handle threshold load. Two 15min sessions a week: \- One for lower legs and core (eccentric calf drops, tibialis raises, planks, glute bridges) – maintain tendon health from run intensity. \- One for flexibility and mobility (hip flexor stretches, foam rolling quads/ITB, thoracic mobility) – to maintain range of motion and prevent tightness from repetitive efforts. Because threshold training already strains muscles, avoid heavy lifting. Keep it light and therapeutic. E.g. do an easy core routine Monday (after weekend load) and a short yoga or mobility session Thursday (prepping for Fri threshold). This should suffice to prevent injuries and maintain stability.

**Note:** This threshold plan requires vigilant recovery: I’d advise the athlete to monitor morning HR, RPE. If signs of overtraining appear (elevated resting HR, poor sleep, performance drop), they should insert an extra easy day or reduce intervals. It’s a fine line but if done carefully, it can raise their power on hills and overall race pace significantly.

### **3\) Sutton-Style Reverse Plan (17 Weeks)**

**Overview:** A plan following Brett Sutton’s principles: first 6 weeks focused on intensity and building strength, next 6 weeks transitioning to more volume and Ironman-specific sessions, final 5 weeks high-volume aerobic \+ taper. This plan is appealing if the athlete feels mentally better doing intensity early (maybe due to weather or preference) and ramping volume later in summer. Peak hours maybe \~16-18 in volume phase; early phase might only be 8-12 hours with lots of intensity.

**Phase Breakdown & Hours:** \- **Speed/Strength Phase (Weeks 17–12; Apr 16 – May 26):** \~6 weeks. Emphasis on high-intensity short intervals in all 3 sports, low cadence work on bike, hill sprints on run, and technique. Hours \~10 hrs/week (lower because intensity is high – allow recovery). Possibly a slight increase by week 12 to \~12h as a bit more easy volume added with daylight improving. \- **Hybrid/Conversion Phase (Weeks 11–7; May 27 – June 30):** 5 weeks bridging. Gradually increase long ride and run, continue some intensity but slightly reduced. Hours \~12-14h/week by end of this phase. Still include weekly hard sessions, but also long aerobic sessions appear. \- **Endurance/Specific Phase (Weeks 6–3; July 1 – July 28):** 4 weeks of big volume and race-specific work. Hours peak \~16-18h. Intensity mostly limited to race-pace or a few short efforts, not much pure speed now. Possibly a big training camp week here (maybe hitting 20h for that week if athlete can manage days off work). This ends \~3 weeks out. \- **Taper (Weeks 2–Race; July 29 – Aug 16):** 2.5 week taper. Keep some short intense bursts to maintain “speed” but overall volume falls 30-40%. E.g. 2 weeks out still maybe \~12h, race week \~6-8h plus race.

**Key Workouts per Phase:** \- *Speed Phase:* \- **Swim:** lots of short intervals. Ex: 20×50m all-out (90% effort) with 20s rest[\[23\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/reverse-periodisation-and-the-new-way-forward#:~:text=it%E2%80%99s%20short%20and%20sharp,keep%20it%20short%20and%20keep); or 10×100m at 1500m pace with 30s rest. Use paddles/band often to build strength (e.g. 5×100 band only drill). Focus on good form under fatigue rather than pure volume. \- **Bike:** intervals like 2×20×1min on/1min off at \>FTP (VO₂ zone)[\[23\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/reverse-periodisation-and-the-new-way-forward#:~:text=it%E2%80%99s%20short%20and%20sharp,keep%20it%20short%20and%20keep) – split into 2 sets to keep quality. Low cadence drills: e.g. 3×10min at 60rpm, moderate gear, focusing on torque (can be during easy ride). Possibly include some big gear sprints (e.g. 8s all-out from slow roll, to mimic those 90% efforts Brett likes at 90% of max). \- **Run:** hill sprints (e.g. 10×30s hill at \~mile race effort, full walk down recovery) and track work (e.g. 12×400m at 3-5k pace, 100m jog rest). No run over 90min; mostly 30-60min runs, some off-bike bricks of 15-20min just to adapt. \- **Brick frequency:** Possibly do short bricks often. Eg: finish most bike sessions with a 10min easy run to groove the “Sutto shuffle” technique off the bike[\[119\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,good%20to%20reduce%20injury%20risk). Also one weekly bike-run brick where run is hard: e.g. Sat: 2h bike with last 10min hard, then 5km all-out run (for speed) – a bit risky, adjust effort to 90% so not truly all-out. \- Hours lower, so more rest: e.g. Monday and Friday could be lighter days or off.

* *Conversion Phase:*

* **Swim:** keep some intensity but add volume per session. e.g. 5×200m at slightly sub-threshold, and a weekly long swim 3k continuous. Still do one short speed set to maintain gains.

* **Bike:** Introduce 3-4h long ride at easy pace if not yet. Keep one threshold session weekly but maybe shorter (e.g. 3×8’ @ FTP) or replace one with a race-pace tempo ride (e.g. 90min at 80% FTP). Increase total mileage \~15%.

* **Run:** Start extending one run to 1.5h then 1h45 by end of phase (likely split or easy). Still include strides/hill sprints for neuromuscular upkeep. Possibly a fartlek run replacing track: e.g. 60min run with 10x1min on/1min off scattered – less structure, building endurance with some speed but not as taxing as formal intervals.

* **Brick:** Increase brick run distance but at moderate intensity. E.g. 3h ride \+ 45min run at steady Z2. Focus now on not killing bricks but making them aerobic to begin simulating IM.

* Essentially, intensity dialed down one notch, volume up.

* *Endurance Phase:*

* **Swim:** big swim sets like 10×300m at IM goal pace (with short rest) to simulate race distance feel, and one straight 3800m swim. Fewer pure sprint sets (maybe a few 50m to keep feel).

* **Bike:** Long rides 5-6h weekly (one could be 180km simulation at controlled effort). Include race-pace intervals: e.g. 3×40’ at IM power in a 5h ride. Focus on aero position, fueling. Possibly one over-distance ride (200km) at moderate effort to push endurance envelope (Brett often did occasional 7h rides).

* **Run:** Key long run \~2.5h done 4-5 weeks out (likely after a swim and ride day prior to simulate fatigue). Many bricks: e.g. weekly brick of 4-5h bike \+ 1h run at or slightly faster than IM pace for first half of run (to practice controlled aggressiveness off bike).

* Intensity now minimal: perhaps one short faster run (like 20min tempo) every 10 days just to keep turnover. Bike might have a few 5min at threshold in long ride, but no full interval sessions beyond maybe a short sharp tune-up mid-block (like 8×2min hard on turbo just for maintenance).

* Big Brick example: 6 weeks out: Swim 1h (continuous 3k), Bike 5h with last 1h at goal IM wattage, Run 1h off bike at goal IM pace negative splitting. That’s a heavy day – not quite race distance but close in structure, then recover 2 days after.

* *Taper:*

* Very similar to others: cut volume, keep a touch of intensity. Possibly still do one last short interval swim and run 10 days out (like 8×100m fast swim, 4×400m fast run) to remind muscles without fatigue. No session longer than 2h in last 10 days (except maybe a 2.5h bike 10 days out). Emphasis on rest.

**Weekly Hours Variation:** Weeks might look like 10h \-\> 12h \-\> 8h (recovery) in speed; then 12h \-\> 14h \-\> 10h (recovery) in conversion; then 15h \-\> 18h \-\> 12h (recovery) in endurance; then tapering 12h \-\> 8h. Provided athlete feels okay.

**Sample Microcycle (Speed Phase, \~11h):** \- Monday: OFF or easy swim 30min technique \+ 20min stretch/foam roll. \- Tuesday: AM Swim speed: 5×100m all-out on 2’ send-off, then 5×50 w/ paddles band all-out[\[117\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=%2A%20Cycling%20at%2060,as%20it%20keeps%20your%20form), c/d (total \~2500m). PM Run: 40min with 10×30s hill sprints at 90% effort, full walk down recovery. \- Wednesday: Bike intervals: 3×(6×1min @ 125% FTP, 1min rest) with 5min easy between sets[\[23\]](https://www.trisutto.com/post/reverse-periodisation-and-the-new-way-forward#:~:text=it%E2%80%99s%20short%20and%20sharp,keep%20it%20short%20and%20keep). Then 30min easy spin cooldown. Brick run: 15min easy off bike. \- Thursday: AM Run aerobic 1hr (mostly Z1-Z2). PM Swim endurance 45min (e.g. 1500m straight at steady pace). \- Friday: Bike big gear: 1.5hr ride with 5×5min hill climbs at 60rpm, HR \~Zone3, spin easy 5min between. Include some downhill to practice handling. Follow immediately with T2 practice and Brick run 5km hard (say at 10k race effort) – simulate running on heavy legs, but keep form. \- Saturday: Long bike 3hr with teammates (could be group ride) – allow some bursts but try to keep mostly Zone2, just enjoy miles. Brick run 20min easy. \- Sunday: Long run 1hr 20min easy \+ strides last 5min. Optional swim recovery 20min or rest.

(This shows intensity focus: Tue swim, Wed bike, Fri brick run are high-intensity; others easy. Volume is lower to accommodate.)

**Hill & Terrain Integration:** \- In speed phase, using hills for strength (hill sprints, low cadence climbs) is direct. Many workouts incorporate hills already. \- Conversion/endurance: schedule outdoor rides on Leeds-like terrain to acclimate. Possibly do some training camp in hills. Brett often liked doing IM pace on courses harder than race so race feels easier – maybe practice on steeper climbs than Leeds occasionally. \- Reverse plan ironically might have slightly *less* specific hill work early (since focusing on short & power), but then heavy focus later. So in endurance phase, do a lot of riding on long climbs, and run some hilly routes to ensure uphill/downhill conditioning.

**Run Durability:** \- Early phase run durability from frequent short runs (maybe 5-6 runs/week but mostly \<1h to avoid breakdown). Brett often prescribes frequent short runs to build mileage without big single runs[\[84\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/essential-run-advice-coach-brett-sutton/?scope=anon#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20my%20belief%20that%20the,%E2%80%9D)[\[110\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/essential-run-advice-coach-brett-sutton/?scope=anon#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20essential%20run%20workouts%20age,four%20workouts%20that%20are%20essential). Eg. running 20-30min off many bikes – adds up to a lot of run time. \- Many short bricks accumulate durability (the “run often off bike” principle) without huge stress of long run[\[119\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,good%20to%20reduce%20injury%20risk). \- Later, they do introduce long runs but often still not mega long: e.g. multiple runs of \~2h rather than one 3h (Brett's note: 50% of race distance as long run for Ironman, i.e. \~21k in training)[\[115\]](https://www.triathlete.com/training/essential-run-advice-coach-brett-sutton/?scope=anon#:~:text=,distance%20for%20the%20Fartlek%20run). \- To follow that, maybe cap long run \~2h15 (about 25-27km) for athlete. Instead, use double runs in a day or back-to-back days to simulate bigger volume (like running 90min on Saturday, 90min Sunday). \- Frequent brick runs also train the legs for late-race without separate long run – e.g. doing a 1h brick after a 5h ride is effectively a “long run” in fatigued state. \- Also emphasize the famous “Sutton shuffle” form: short stride, quick cadence – easier on legs for durability[\[175\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=why%20it%27s%20been%20a%20cornerstone,much%20success%20in%20this%20area). The athlete should practice this in bricks, focusing on a quick cadence \~90 and not over-striding, to reduce impact. That helps them get through Ironman marathon with less trauma.

**Minimal Strength Integration:** \- In speed phase, many workouts double as strength (swim paddles, big gear bike, hill sprints). Traditional weightlifting can be minimal. Possibly include 1 gym session/week focusing on general strength and injury prevention: e.g. squats at moderate weight, plyometrics like box jumps (to boost power), core work (planks, Russian twists). \- Brett’s view is strength is built in swim/bike; he often doesn’t have athletes spend much time in gym beyond bodyweight circuits[\[117\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=%2A%20Cycling%20at%2060,as%20it%20keeps%20your%20form). So adopt that: push-ups, pull-ups, lunges, etc., 1-2x/wk 20min, especially if athlete enjoys it. \- Key is, as volume picks up, drop heavy strength to avoid adding fatigue. Perhaps stop weighted leg exercises once endurance phase begins, continue just core maintenance. \- Emphasize flexibility and mobility e.g. 10min daily stretch, because reverse periodization can tighten muscles with all that intensity then volume. \- Summed up: strength via sport-specific means (paddles, low cadence) and short functional training is enough.

Overall, this reverse plan, if executed well, should peak the athlete’s speed and power by mid-season, then convert it into enduring strength for hills and distance just in time for Leeds. It’s a bit complex and demands listening to body daily, but it could yield a very well-rounded fitness (fast and strong).

---

Which blueprint is “best” depends on Chris Dick’s preference: \- The **Pyramidal Plan** is the safest, balanced approach – likely the top recommendation for his context (it hits all his objectives steadily). \- The **Norwegian Lite Plan** is high-risk/high-reward – suitable if he loves numbers, has a history of handling intensity, and limited time. It could produce great threshold gains but requires careful recovery management. \- The **Reverse Plan** is good if he tends to respond well to intensity and craves variety, or if schedule constraints make early season volume hard (keep the focus on intensity during winter and build endurance in summer). It emphasizes not “losing speed” while building endurance.

Each has trade-offs, but all are internally consistent systems.

## Leeds-Specific Module

Training for Ironman Leeds’ **hilly bike course and demanding run** requires tailored strategies in pacing, muscular endurance, cadence, and brick training:

**Pacing for Long Climbs and Rolling Terrain:** The athlete must practice a **variable power strategy** on the bike: climbing at slightly above average power, descending and flats slightly below, to maximize speed while not blowing up. In training, include rides where you intentionally *surge moderately* on hills and recover on descents[\[176\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/107qucp/seeking_advice_on_how_to_optimally_train_and_race/#:~:text=Seeking%20advice%20on%20how%20to,pace%20yourself%20going%20uphill)[\[177\]](https://www.tri247.com/race-day-tips/half-ironman-middle-distance-triathlon-pacing-hills-fuelling-race-day-tips#:~:text=Keep%20it%20smooth%20%E2%80%93%20ride,your%20own%20race). For example, target \~80-85% FTP on 5-10 min climbs (just below threshold) and \~60% FTP on descents to recover[\[7\]](https://www.tri247.com/race-day-tips/half-ironman-middle-distance-triathlon-pacing-hills-fuelling-race-day-tips#:~:text=On%20the%20climbs%2C%20try%20to,have%20a%20few%20pennies%20left)[\[178\]](https://www.tri247.com/race-day-tips/half-ironman-middle-distance-triathlon-pacing-hills-fuelling-race-day-tips#:~:text=Configure%20your%20bike%20computer%20so,time%E2%80%99%20measure%20of%20effort). Use a power meter or HR to ensure you’re not way over threshold on climbs – a common race mistake. Training wise: \- Do workouts like 3×15min uphill at goal climb wattage (e.g. 85% FTP), focusing on steady effort, then coasting easy after each to simulate cresting a hill and recovering[\[7\]](https://www.tri247.com/race-day-tips/half-ironman-middle-distance-triathlon-pacing-hills-fuelling-race-day-tips#:~:text=On%20the%20climbs%2C%20try%20to,have%20a%20few%20pennies%20left)[\[179\]](https://www.tri247.com/race-day-tips/half-ironman-middle-distance-triathlon-pacing-hills-fuelling-race-day-tips#:~:text=Image%3A%20Challenge%20Kaiserwinkl,Photo%20Credit%20Jos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Hourcade). \- Practice *cresting* hills: in training, avoid the habit of pushing harder and harder to summit. Instead, practice keeping a cap and maybe easing slightly near the top to lower HR before the descent (so you recover faster).

Also, do *simulation rides*: If possible, train on the Leeds course or similar. If the course has, say, 8 significant climbs, design a ride to include 8 hard climbs and practice fueling and pacing between them.

On rolling terrain, practice shifting and power smoothing: e.g. on a roller-coaster route, aim to not spike above a certain wattage on each rise (maybe 250W cap if FTP 300W) – get used to downshifting quickly and spinning up rather than grinding slowly. This preserves legs for run[\[7\]](https://www.tri247.com/race-day-tips/half-ironman-middle-distance-triathlon-pacing-hills-fuelling-race-day-tips#:~:text=On%20the%20climbs%2C%20try%20to,have%20a%20few%20pennies%20left)[\[178\]](https://www.tri247.com/race-day-tips/half-ironman-middle-distance-triathlon-pacing-hills-fuelling-race-day-tips#:~:text=Configure%20your%20bike%20computer%20so,time%E2%80%99%20measure%20of%20effort).

**Muscular Endurance vs Aerobic Trade-offs:** Climbing uses more muscular force (especially if low cadence) – train both muscular endurance (force production over time) and aerobic capacity. \- Include **low-cadence interval training** (like 45-60 rpm climbs) to strengthen quads and glutes[\[83\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,as%20it%20keeps%20your%20form), but limit to \~1x/week to avoid over-fatigue. This builds specific strength for hills so you recruit slower muscle fibers efficiently. \- Balance that with normal cadence climbs focusing on aerobic power so you don’t rely solely on muscle force. For instance, alternate: one week do low-cadence hill repeats, next week do high-cadence (85-90 rpm) hill repeats at same power – training cardiovascular side. \- On runs, incorporate some hilly long runs – climbing engages more muscle (calves, glutes). But caution: downhill running is eccentric – build tolerance gradually (short downhill strides initially, later longer descents). Strength training (eccentric calf raises, quads) supports this.

Ultimately, on race day, recognize that **climbing will spike HR** – so plan to deliberately eat/drink right after climbs (when HR is dropping) to aid digestion (when HR high, GI blood flow low). Use training to note how quickly your breathing recovers after cresting – you might practice easing off slightly 30s before a climb ends to catch breath.

**Cadence and Torque Management:** Many amateurs grind up hills in too big a gear – causing excessive muscle fatigue. The athlete should determine an optimal climbing cadence (perhaps \~75-85 rpm, or higher if they’re more spinner) in training. \- Do specific cadence drills: e.g. ride 10min uphill at 70rpm, then same hill at 90rpm next time, see which feels best combination of power and HR. Generally, a moderate cadence (not extremely low) reduces leg strain and allows better run after[\[180\]](https://www.tri247.com/race-day-tips/half-ironman-middle-distance-triathlon-pacing-hills-fuelling-race-day-tips#:~:text=Watch%20your%20cadence%20%E2%80%93%20be,wary%20of%20the%20grind)[\[181\]](https://www.tri247.com/race-day-tips/half-ironman-middle-distance-triathlon-pacing-hills-fuelling-race-day-tips#:~:text=We%20recently%20caught%20up%20with,%E2%80%9D). \- Practically: ensure you have proper gearing on bike to maintain cadence on steep sections (maybe a 34t small chainring, 30+ tooth cassette cog). Then practice shifting early as grade changes to maintain momentum and cadence rather than bogging down. \- On flats or headwinds, practice high torque intervals vs high cadence intervals to be adaptable. For example, 2×10min at 85rpm vs 2×10 at 95rpm at same power; being comfortable in both ranges helps when terrain forces changes. \- Running: high cadence (short quick steps) on uphills is often recommended to avoid overloading calves. Practice uphill running with quick turnover (think “light feet”). On downhills, practice slightly lengthening stride but keeping cadence reasonably high too, to avoid shock on each step.

**Bike-Run Interaction on Hilly Courses:** A hilly bike means a tougher run usually – quads and calves may be more trashed. So **brick workouts are key:** \- Include **hilly bricks** – e.g. ride 3h with lots of climbs, then run 45min with some hills. This teaches pacing: you’ll likely feel heavy legs, so you learn to start the run conservatively and use a high cadence, low impact style until legs loosen[\[177\]](https://www.tri247.com/race-day-tips/half-ironman-middle-distance-triathlon-pacing-hills-fuelling-race-day-tips#:~:text=Keep%20it%20smooth%20%E2%80%93%20ride,your%20own%20race)[\[182\]](https://www.tri247.com/race-day-tips/half-ironman-middle-distance-triathlon-pacing-hills-fuelling-race-day-tips#:~:text=top,in%20a%20game%20of%20cat). \- Practice run fueling right after a hard ride portion. Often after climbing, athletes can’t eat on bike due to effort; they might start run with slight deficit. A strategy: crest a major climb \~10-15 min before bike finish so you can eat and lower HR, then T2, then start run better fueled. Work on in training: simulate finishing a ride with HR high, then taking a gel at T2 and running – does your stomach handle it? If not, adjust plan to take nutrition earlier. \- Train “downhill running skill:” On course, downhills can pound legs or be free speed. In training, find some gentle downhill and practice leaning forward slightly, quick cadence, not braking too much (which causes muscle damage). But don’t sprint them; focus on efficiency. This can make a big difference in hilly runs because some people waste energy braking downhill. Strong quads from bike help here too. \- Also consider doing a few long bricks with final miles of run at target pace on tired legs. This is more mental: shows you that even after hard bike, you can hold form.

Summarily, tackling Leeds means being strong and smart on bike – not overcooking on climbs, using appropriate cadence, fueling strategically – and translating that into a controlled marathon (likely with some hills as well). Training should simulate those demands closely, including teaching the athlete how to pace within each climb (maybe stand vs sit transitions, etc.) and how to recover on descents and flats so that overall effort stays consistent.

For example, a guideline often cited: *cap power at \~FTP on any climb*, even if speed is slow, to avoid anaerobic efforts that spike lactate[\[7\]](https://www.tri247.com/race-day-tips/half-ironman-middle-distance-triathlon-pacing-hills-fuelling-race-day-tips#:~:text=On%20the%20climbs%2C%20try%20to,have%20a%20few%20pennies%20left)[\[183\]](https://www.tri247.com/race-day-tips/half-ironman-middle-distance-triathlon-pacing-hills-fuelling-race-day-tips#:~:text=Image%3A%20Challenge%20Kaiserwinkl,Photo%20Credit%20Jos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Hourcade). If athlete trains with that rule, it becomes second nature. Similarly for run: have an RPE or HR cap for uphills (maybe don’t exceed HR X on any uphill in first half of marathon). Use training runs to find what feels sustainable.

In conclusion, training with these specifics ensures the athlete arrives at Ironman Leeds not only fit, but also technically prepared to handle the hills without letting them “destroy the run,” fulfilling one of their main objectives.

## TT Bike Transition Module

Because our athlete is transitioning from a road bike to a new TT bike (time trial/triathlon bike), it’s crucial to integrate this change carefully to maximize aero benefits by race day and avoid injury. Key areas: timing of switch, position adaptation, long ride adjustments, and risk mitigation.

**Timing and Strategy for TT Adaptation:** \- **Start Early (17-12 weeks out):** Ideally, begin using the TT bike around \~4 months before race (which is our timeline). Week 17 (start of plan) have them do short trainer sessions on TT bike to get a feel. The first 2-3 weeks, limit to \<1hr rides, focusing on comfort and tweaking position. \- **Bike Fit:** Immediately or even before starting structured plan, get a professional fit on the TT bike. This ensures proper saddle height/setback, reach, arm pad position, etc., to balance aero and comfort[\[184\]](https://trainright.com/cycling-triathlon-training-tips-workout-adapting-to-new-aero-position/#:~:text=,Power)[\[185\]](https://trainright.com/cycling-triathlon-training-tips-workout-adapting-to-new-aero-position/#:~:text=Optimal%20bike%20fit%20is%20a,can%C2%A0compromise%20comfort%20for%20increased%20aerodynamic). A fit that is “reasonably aero, reasonably comfortable, and allows power” is the goal (Ironman position is a balance)[\[185\]](https://trainright.com/cycling-triathlon-training-tips-workout-adapting-to-new-aero-position/#:~:text=Optimal%20bike%20fit%20is%20a,can%C2%A0compromise%20comfort%20for%20increased%20aerodynamic)[\[186\]](https://trainright.com/cycling-triathlon-training-tips-workout-adapting-to-new-aero-position/#:~:text=one%20of%20the%20other%20two%2C,to%2C%20or%20that%20you%20won%E2%80%99t). \- **Incremental Increase:** Use rule of thumb: increase time in aero position by \~10-15% per week. E.g. week1: maybe 30min continuous in aerobars; week2: 45min; week4: 90min, etc. If any neck/back pain, pause increases until resolved. \- **Mixed Riding Initially:** It’s fine to do some rides still on road bike (especially recovery rides or group rides), but progressively do key sessions on TT bike. By \~8 weeks out, all long rides should be on TT bike if possible[\[187\]](https://trainright.com/cycling-triathlon-training-tips-workout-adapting-to-new-aero-position/#:~:text=technology%20has%20changed%20there%20are,often%20receives%20the%20least%20attention)[\[188\]](https://trainright.com/cycling-triathlon-training-tips-workout-adapting-to-new-aero-position/#:~:text=or%20a%20112,you%20make%20to%20that%20position). Possibly keep one road bike ride if comfort is still an issue, but aim to be mostly TT. \- **Position Adjustments:** Your body needs time to adapt to different hip angle, shoulder pressure. The plan: first get a comfortable but slightly conservative aero position (maybe not slam front end low immediately). Ride in that a couple weeks. If it feels fine, gradually adjust more aero (e.g. lower front end 5mm every 1-2 weeks)[\[189\]](https://trainright.com/cycling-triathlon-training-tips-workout-adapting-to-new-aero-position/#:~:text=)[\[190\]](https://trainright.com/cycling-triathlon-training-tips-workout-adapting-to-new-aero-position/#:~:text=The%20key%20to%20adjusting%20your,2mm%20each). The idea: incremental changes allow body adaptation without major disruption[\[189\]](https://trainright.com/cycling-triathlon-training-tips-workout-adapting-to-new-aero-position/#:~:text=). Each adjustment, give at least a week or two and 2-3 long rides to adapt before next. Stop adjusting around 4-5 weeks out so you have a stable position ingrained for race. \- **Flexibility and Strength:** incorporate specific exercises: e.g. hip flexor stretches (tight in aero), glute activation (to ensure power in closed hip angle), neck extensor exercises (to better hold aero head position). Many find yoga for cyclists helpful as they adapt TT posture. Work on these concurrently as you ramp TT time.

**Aero Long Rides and Pacing Practice:** \- Once adapted \~50% time in aerobars, start doing **entire long rides** mostly in aero. Perhaps break it: e.g. 30min aero / 5min sit up periodically to stretch until you can sustain \>1h in aero continuous[\[191\]](https://trainright.com/cycling-triathlon-training-tips-workout-adapting-to-new-aero-position/#:~:text=)[\[192\]](https://trainright.com/cycling-triathlon-training-tips-workout-adapting-to-new-aero-position/#:~:text=placing%20any%20significant%20performance%20demands,intervals%20in%20your%20race%20position). By race, you want to be comfortable staying down for extended periods (aside from big climbs). \- During long trainer rides, purposely **do intervals in aero** not sitting up[\[191\]](https://trainright.com/cycling-triathlon-training-tips-workout-adapting-to-new-aero-position/#:~:text=)[\[193\]](https://trainright.com/cycling-triathlon-training-tips-workout-adapting-to-new-aero-position/#:~:text=by%20performing%20intervals%20in%20your,race%20position). It’s noted that some power loss can occur in aero until adapted – practicing intervals (like threshold or tempo) in aero on a slight incline (as recommended by Jim Rutberg) helps adaptation[\[193\]](https://trainright.com/cycling-triathlon-training-tips-workout-adapting-to-new-aero-position/#:~:text=by%20performing%20intervals%20in%20your,race%20position)[\[194\]](https://trainright.com/cycling-triathlon-training-tips-workout-adapting-to-new-aero-position/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20best%20ways,good%20as%20you%20are%20at). For example, find a \~3-4% grade or use trainer with slight resistance and do steady efforts in aero – it trains muscles to fire in that position and fights urge to come up when it gets tough. \- **Pacing practice:** The athlete should watch power/HR in aero vs upright – there’s often drift. Over time, aim to have similar power output in aero. Early on, they might see e.g. 10% drop in power in aero due to unfamiliar muscle recruitment[\[185\]](https://trainright.com/cycling-triathlon-training-tips-workout-adapting-to-new-aero-position/#:~:text=Optimal%20bike%20fit%20is%20a,can%C2%A0compromise%20comfort%20for%20increased%20aerodynamic)[\[195\]](https://trainright.com/cycling-triathlon-training-tips-workout-adapting-to-new-aero-position/#:~:text=balanced%20aero%20positions%20around%3B%20it%E2%80%99s,you%20make%20to%20that%20position); as they adapt, this delta shrinks. They should track this progress. \- They must also practice **head position and sighting** (if applicable in tri, though in Ironman the roads closed, but still need to look for turns etc.). Often neck fatigue is big: so on some training rides, commit to, say, 20min intervals where you keep head in race position (looking up from aero without straining too high) – to build neck endurance. \- Additionally, do some **windy rides** in aero to practice bike handling. A TT bike can feel twitchy in crosswinds or downhills; gradually get comfortable: start on moderate descents in aero, eventually do faster ones if safe. If not comfortable, plan to sit up on very technical sections, but the more you can handle in aero, the better. \- Pacing-wise, they should simulate what effort hills and flats feel like on TT: e.g. climbing in aero vs on bullhorns. For moderate climbs, staying in aero may be fine (less wind but uses more quads); experiment during training which climbs they can stay down vs when to come up to breathe or torque. Also practice cornering and braking – TT bikes handle differently, so do drills in a parking lot or quiet road (figure-8s, emergency stops).

**Risk Mitigation for Late TT Adoption:** \- The main risks: **discomfort leading to reduced training** (if it’s painful, athlete might cut sessions short), **injury** (neck/back strain), and **not being dialed by race** (losing watts or confidence). \- To mitigate: \- **Listen to pain signals:** differentiate adaptation ache vs injurious pain. Muscle soreness (e.g. sore trapezius, or tired lower back) is normal and can be eased with strength/mobility work and continued adaptation. Sharp pain or numbness (hands, crotch) indicates bike fit or position needs immediate tweak[\[189\]](https://trainright.com/cycling-triathlon-training-tips-workout-adapting-to-new-aero-position/#:~:text=)[\[190\]](https://trainright.com/cycling-triathlon-training-tips-workout-adapting-to-new-aero-position/#:~:text=The%20key%20to%20adjusting%20your,2mm%20each). E.g. numbness in crotch – adjust saddle tilt or position; knee pain – check saddle height/setback again. Don’t “push through” serious pain hoping to adapt – fix the fit or position. \- **Increase rest if needed during adaptation:** If after first couple aero rides you feel extremely fatigued in new muscle groups, take an extra easy day or do next ride on road bike. It’s better to take small step back than get injured and lose weeks. \- **Saddle sores/pressure:** New saddle or position can cause sores. Use high-quality shorts, lots of chamois cream. Stand out of saddle periodically in training (e.g. 5-10 sec every 10-15 min) to get blood flow. If persistent issues, consider a different saddle (split-nose often better for aero) – do this well before race. \- **Confidence on race day:** a risk is feeling unstable or unsure on TT bike if not enough practice. To mitigate, do a lower priority event or long ride fully on TT bike to simulate the race environment (maybe a 70.3 or century ride event). If none available, at least do a solo race rehearsal (as mentioned: brick with race nutrition, gear, etc. on TT bike). \- **Equipment familiarity:** new TT bike means new gear like hydration system, maybe electronic shifting, etc. Practice all of it: e.g. grabbing bottle or straw in aero, switching between base bar and aero bar braking/shifting. Do *not* wait until race to use integrated hydration or bento box – practice in training. \- **Spare preparation:** Flats and mechanicals on TT can be trickier (rear dropout with horizontal maybe, etc.). Rehearse changing a flat on your TT bike; make sure you can remove/install wheels with any thru-axles or hidden brake quirks. This reduces panic in race if something happens. \- **Visibility & traffic:** if training on open roads, be aware that in aero you have a lower head position – scanning for traffic requires deliberate effort (can’t turn head easily like upright). So practice what your head-turn angle needs to be, maybe use a helmet or glasses with rear-view mirrors if comfortable. Safety first. \- Finally, **time management:** transitioning to TT can temporarily reduce power output until adapted[\[196\]](https://trainright.com/cycling-triathlon-training-tips-workout-adapting-to-new-aero-position/#:~:text=As%20you%E2%80%99re%20making%20your%20incremental,intervals%20in%20your%20race%20position)[\[197\]](https://trainright.com/cycling-triathlon-training-tips-workout-adapting-to-new-aero-position/#:~:text=position,intervals%20in%20your%20race%20position). This might freak athlete out (e.g. “I’m slower on my new aero bike\!”). Emphasize from beginning that this is normal and will improve. To manage ego, perhaps do key power tests on road bike as baseline, and gauge TT progress separately. Over weeks, track the gap closing. Also focus on actual speed – sometimes even with lower power, you’ll be faster due to aero. That’s motivating: do a known loop on road bike vs TT same watts, see speed difference. That reinforces why enduring the adaptation is worth it.

**When to finalize position:** Aim to have your “race position” locked in by \~4 weeks out[\[189\]](https://trainright.com/cycling-triathlon-training-tips-workout-adapting-to-new-aero-position/#:~:text=). That means no more major changes; spend those final weeks just training in it, to let body fully adjust. Use last long rides to ensure you can sustain it for full IM distance without debilitating pain. If 4 weeks out you still have big discomfort, might need to slightly relax position (raise bars a bit, etc.) – better to be 5% less aero but able to ride strong and run well, than super aero but coming off bike wrecked.

In summary, treat the TT bike like a new sport initially: ramp up like you did when starting triathlon – small frequent sessions, focus on technique (fit), then gradually merge it so by race day it’s second nature. The aim is by Aug 16, the athlete can ride Leeds fully in aero unless on steep climbs, and come off the bike having saved watts and energy thanks to aerodynamic efficiency combined with being accustomed to that riding posture.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tests

Implementing a new training plan (especially a specific philosophy) requires checking progress and ensuring it’s the right fit. We propose some diagnostics at weeks 4, 8, 12, and tests to catch mismatches early. Also, a 2-week trial protocol to evaluate a philosophy before fully committing.

**What Should Improve by Week 4, 8, 12:**

* **By Week 4:**

* The athlete should notice **improving aerobic metrics**: e.g. heart rate for easy runs dropping for same pace (sign of base building), or power at HR zone2 increasing[\[80\]](https://mastersoftri.com/low-intensity-training-is-the-primary-influencer/#:~:text=,trip%20us%20into%20doing%20more)[\[124\]](https://mastersoftri.com/low-intensity-training-is-the-primary-influencer/#:~:text=,low%20intensity%20and%20following%20the). Possibly measure via a low-intensity test: do a 1-hour easy ride or a 30min easy run at set HR, see if distance covered is a bit more than at start.

* Subjectively, they should feel **less sore** from initial sessions – the body starts adapting. If by week 4 every threshold workout leaves them exhausted for days, that’s a red flag (maybe too intense or not enough recovery in plan).

* Any **weight stabilization** after early training start (if weight needed adjusting). If they had off-season weight to lose, maybe a slight drop by week 4 from increased training (though not critical).

* Specifically, if following threshold-heavy plan: by week 4, they should see threshold pace/power up a tad or intervals feeling more controlled at same pace. If following high-volume: maybe long run or ride can be extended with same comfort level.

* Ideally, a **field test** around week 4: e.g. do a 5k time trial or an FTP test to gauge early improvement. I’d expect small gains (like FTP up 3-5%, or 5k time 1-2% faster) if plan is effective. Not huge, but some.

* **By Week 8:**

* **Durability improvements:** e.g. able to complete longer bricks or long runs without excessive fatigue. The athlete might note, “I ran 2 hours for first time and felt good the next day,” indicating improved endurance.

* **Better pacing & fueling** in training: by week 8 they should have experimented and nailed down a fueling strategy that prevents bonking in long sessions. E.g. by now, a 4h ride with fueling every 15min feels routine, whereas in week1 maybe they under-fueled and struggled late. If fueling is still problematic by week8 (e.g. GI distress or bonking episodes), adjust plan and perhaps type/amount of nutrition.

* **Hill performance improvement:** if hills are a focus, by week 8 they might see certain hills can be climbed faster or at lower HR than before. Maybe repeat a benchmark hill and compare HR/power curve.

* **Swim speed retention:** often as tri training volume rises, swim suffers if not attended. By week8, they should still be near their baseline swim pace or improved, not slowed. If significantly slower, it’s a sign swim is being neglected or fatigue too high – needs fixing.

* **Recovery metrics:** Perhaps resting HR consistently a bit lower, or HRV (if they use it) improved, indicating better fitness. They also should identify their recovery pattern (e.g. after long brick, they know by day2 after they feel normal again; if not, maybe training load too high).

* Possibly do a **mid-plan race or test** around week 8-9 (like a half marathon or a 70.3 simulation) to gauge. Expect improvement from baseline. E.g. if they ran a half marathon in base period in 1:45, by week8 maybe 1:40 if all going well (just an example).

* **By Week 12:**

* They should be hitting near peak training numbers: e.g. longest rides 5-6h, long runs \~2.5h – and crucially, **recovering within 2-3 days from those**. If by week12, a big session knocks them out for a week, plan might be too aggressive.

* **Threshold/pace targets should be significantly improved:** e.g. threshold power perhaps 5-10% up from week0, or long run pace at given HR maybe 15-20 sec/km faster than before[\[172\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873141/#:~:text=Ironman%20distance%20triathlon,training%20intensity%20distribution%20regarding%20performance)[\[42\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873141/#:~:text=,triathletes%20in%20the%20three%20segments).

* Another measure: do a **race-pace brick** (like 4h \+ 1h run at goal IM pace) in week12-13. They should complete it feeling like they “could have done more” – indicating goal pace is realistic. If that brick nearly killed them or they couldn’t hold goal pace, that’s a warning sign to adjust expectations or training.

* **TT bike comfort:** if new TT, by week12 they should be fully comfortable doing majority in aero. If not, might need to revisit fit or do more adaptation work.

* **Injury status:** ideally zero injuries and any niggles under control by mid-plan. If persistent pain by week12 (like Achilles tendonitis hasn’t improved or a stress reaction developing), that’s a sign training needs altering (likely intensity or volume reduction or form correction).

* **Mental outlook:** By week12, burnout signs might appear if plan misaligned. The athlete should still be motivated. If they dread most sessions or feel chronically tired, it’s a mismatch sign.

**Warning Signs of Mismatch:**

* **Performance stagnation or decline:** If after \~6-8 weeks, key markers (like threshold power, run pace) haven’t improved or have worsened, the chosen philosophy might not be working[\[172\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873141/#:~:text=Ironman%20distance%20triathlon,training%20intensity%20distribution%20regarding%20performance)[\[42\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873141/#:~:text=,triathletes%20in%20the%20three%20segments) (or the athlete is over/under doing it). E.g. if doing threshold plan but threshold pace isn’t budging or you feel slower at moderate efforts, maybe too much fatigue – warn sign to adjust volume or switch approach.

* **Excessive fatigue/inability to hit targets:** If the athlete frequently cannot complete scheduled key workouts (always cutting intervals short, etc.), or having to skip sessions due to fatigue – plan might be too intense or not enough recovery. E.g. polarized approach but athlete can’t muster energy for the hard days – maybe they need more rest or a different approach with less intensity.

* **Recurring injuries or niggles:** If an athlete on threshold-heavy plan starts getting niggles in calves and they don’t resolve with minor changes, perhaps too much intensity – mismatch for their body. Or on high volume plan they keep getting sick or fatigued – their lifestyle might not allow that volume.

* **Mental dread consistently:** While some grind is expected, if by week4 they absolutely dread every threshold day or find the monotony unbearable, that’s misalignment with personality. E.g. some athletes hate structure – forcing a Norwegian style might demotivate them. Or opposite: someone who craves measurable progress might feel lost in a pure volume plan – they might get bored or uneasy with lack of intensity feedback.

* **No improvement in limiter:** The plan should address weaknesses – if the athlete’s weakness (like climbing power) is not improving after weeks, maybe plan doesn’t tackle it right. E.g. athlete is still struggling on hills as much as before – maybe not enough strength work; adjust or reconsider approach.

* **Data signs:** HR not dropping on easy days (chronic elevation), very depressed HRmax (a sign of overtraining sometimes), or poor sleep HRV – objective signs plan is overshooting capacity.

If these warnings appear, the athlete should talk to a coach or at least adjust plan (extra rest, reduce intensity load, etc.). Mismatch doesn’t always mean scrap entire philosophy – sometimes just volume or intensity tweaks. But if fundamental (e.g. athlete just cannot handle double threshold days), might pivot to a different approach (like reduce intensity frequency in favor of volume).

**2-Week Trial Protocol to Test Philosophy Fit:**

Before fully committing to one approach, the athlete can do a 2-week mini-block as a trial, especially if deciding between e.g. threshold vs polarized.

Here’s how: \- **Week 1 (Trial)**: Implement a representative week of the philosophy *in a moderate way*: \- If testing Norwegian/threshold: Plan 2 days of threshold intervals (maybe Tue run, Fri bike), rest easy around. See how they cope. Check: are they hitting paces without going to well? How’s recovery after 2-3 days? \- If testing High volume: do a week of higher mileage with mostly low intensity, maybe one short tempo. See if they enjoy the volume or if it crushes them/time management issues. \- If testing reverse: do one week focusing on short intense stuff – e.g. interval sets in each sport – gauge enthusiasm and physical response (sore but okay, or too exhausting?). \- They should simulate a lighter version (to avoid needing taper into it) but enough to sense if it’s energizing or draining.

* **Week 2 (Active Recovery & Evaluation)**: Take mostly easy week (maybe 50-60% load) to recover and reflect. During this week, do some low-key tests:

* E.g. mid-week do an “aerobic check” run 5k at base HR to see if trial impacted fatigue.

* And perhaps a repeat of a key workout from prior routine to see difference (like do the same swim set you did before trial, see if faster or slower).

* Evaluate metrics: Resting HR, mood, sleep quality after trial week.

* Most importantly, **subjective**: Did you feel motivated by the trial workouts or dreading them? E.g. maybe threshold sessions felt satisfying or maybe too stressful.

* Check schedule fit: Did you manage time for those sessions easily? (Threshold sessions are shorter, maybe that freed time – good if busy. High volume trial might have caused work/life stress.)

* **Decision Point:** If after 2-week trial the athlete feels:

* Physically good adaptation (not overly fatigued, maybe already feeling a bit fitter/ faster in some efforts) and mentally positive – likely a good fit.

* If physically beaten up or signs of injury and mentally negative, likely not a fit or needs modification.

For instance, an athlete trials double threshold and finds by day 5 Achilles is sore and they hated life – likely scrap or heavily adapt that plan. Or they tried polarized and by end of week said “I feel great and those intervals were fun” – good sign.

It’s important the trial be done when relatively fresh (like not after a race or heavy period) so results aren’t skewed by prior fatigue. Also, 2 weeks is short – it won’t show performance gains really, but it shows *tolerance and preference*. Use that more.

Alternatively, if trial neither felt great nor terrible, one might do another 2-week trial of another approach and compare which felt better on similar evaluation points.

This method prevents fully wasting 8-10 weeks on a wrong approach – better to discover mismatches early. However, caution: any new training can feel tough in first week or two (like starting threshold training will hurt initially). So differentiate initial shock vs fundamental incompatibility: \- If it's just muscle soreness but you kind of enjoyed hitting numbers – maybe you just need adaptation time, not a plan fault. \- If it’s overwhelming fatigue or real injury signs – that’s more clearly plan misfit.

Finally, involve either a coach or training buddy in the decision – sometimes an outside perspective picks up “you seemed much happier in week X vs week Y of trial.”

By making these diagnostics and tests routine, the athlete can steer their training early and ensure the chosen philosophy is delivering and sustainable, rather than realizing it too late when either underprepared or overtrained. This “steer as you go” approach is especially important in self-coaching a detailed plan.

## Coach Selection (Optional)

If the athlete decides to hire a coach to guide their Ironman journey, ensuring the coach’s philosophy aligns with the chosen approach is vital. Here are **20 interview questions** and some **red flags** regarding philosophy mismatch:

**20 Coach Interview Questions:** 1\. “What is your overall coaching philosophy or approach for Ironman training?” – (Looking for whether the emphasis on volume, intensity, etc., matches Chris Dick’s goals – e.g. threshold focus or volume focus). 2\. “How do you determine the right intensity distribution for an athlete?” – (Do they use 80/20, threshold training, etc. – and does it align with the plan outlined for Chris?). 3\. “Can you give an example week of training you’d prescribe 4 months out from an Ironman for someone like Chris?” – (This concrete example reveals whether they lean heavy on intervals or base). 4\. “How do you incorporate hill training for a hilly Ironman course?” – (Important for Leeds – expect mention of hill repeats, strength work). 5\. “What’s your approach to brick workouts and race-specific sessions?” – (Confirm they build bricks regularly; if not, the philosophy may not be ideal). 6\. “How much volume do you typically have mid-level age-groupers peak at for Ironman?” – (If they say 8 hours and Chris expects 15, that’s misalignment; or vice versa). 7\. “Do you use more heart-rate, pace/power, or RPE to guide training intensity?” – (This shows if they are data-driven or more feel-based; match with Chris’s preference). 8\. “How do you monitor an athlete’s fatigue and recovery?” – (They should mention HRV, resting HR, mood, or TrainingPeaks metrics – showing whether their approach is scientific or intuitive). 9\. “What’s your experience with athletes using lactate testing or other advanced metrics? Is it part of your method?” – (If Chris is intrigued by the Norwegian model, a coach familiar with lactate may be a better fit). 10\. “Can you describe how you would periodize Chris’s training from now to Ironman race day?” – (Look for mention of base/build/taper or reverse periodization to understand their structure). 11\. “How do you handle nutrition planning in training and racing?” – (A good coach will incorporate fueling practice so the philosophy covers execution as well). 12\. “What’s your view on strength training for triathletes, and how would you integrate it?” – (If Chris values strength work like Brett Sutton prescribes, a coach who dismisses it or demands excessive gym time might be a mismatch). 13\. “How often do you communicate and adjust the plan?” – (Not philosophy per se, but this reveals whether they support dynamic adjustments, which matters if Chris prefers responsive coaching). 14\. “Can you give examples of athletes you coached and their training style relative to volume vs intensity?” – (If they describe all their athletes doing 20h weeks, but Chris can only commit 12, that’s incompatible). 15\. “What metrics do you use to decide if training is working or needs change?” – (Expect answers like test workouts or threshold checks; “we just follow the plan no matter what” is a red flag for Chris). 16\. “How do you personalize training for individual athletes’ strengths and weaknesses?” – (Ensures they won’t cookie-cutter Chris’s program, especially given his hill-specific goals). 17\. “What is your approach to tapering?” – (Checks if they follow conventional versus aggressive tapers and whether that suits Chris’s recovery needs). 18\. “How do you respond when an athlete isn’t handling the planned load or intensity?” – (They should explain the adjustments they’d make, indicating flexibility rather than dogma). 19\. “Have you coached athletes with a similar profile to Chris (mid-level, multiple IMs, limited time) and how did you approach it?” – (Looking for proven success and method alignment). 20\. “Why do you think your approach would be effective for Chris specifically?” – (This forces them to connect their philosophy to his context; a thoughtful answer shows they listened and applied it).

**Philosophy Mismatch Red Flags:** \- Coach dismisses your questions about approach, saying “just trust me, it works for everyone.” (Lack of adaptability – some coaches like Sutton ask for blind trust[\[121\]](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts212/#:~:text=,his%20success%20with%20female%20athletes), which only works if athlete is on board – if not comfortable, it’s a red flag). \- They strongly advocate a method you know you don’t enjoy or handle well. E.g. “My athletes do speedwork year-round, lots of fast track sessions,” but you’ve been injury-prone with that – mismatch. \- The coach’s communication style doesn’t fit approach: e.g. if doing Norwegian-ish approach, need detailed feedback; if coach doesn’t do analysis or lactate, might not fully implement that style. \- Overemphasis on one discipline at expense of your known limiter. E.g. you mention your run struggles, but coach says “we’ll continue to bike 5x/week and run only 2x” without justification – misalignment with your focus (some coaches might undervalue run durability if they come from a bike background, etc.). \- They promise quick fixes or use buzzwords without substance (“We’ll raise your FTP by 50W in 4 weeks with HIIT – trust me.”). Overpromising indicates a one-size-fits-all or unrealistic approach, likely philosophically incompatible with evidence-based training. \- Unwillingness to adapt to athlete feedback: If in interview they seem rigid (“No matter what, we do 3 key runs each week”), you sense they might not listen if you feel overworked. \- Philosophical conflict with athlete’s life: e.g. coach says “To do Ironman right, you must train 20 hours a week minimum” but you only have 12 – that’s a practical mismatch and a bit of dogma on their part. \- They downplay things important to you: e.g. if you believe in tech and data, but coach says “I don’t look at numbers, just go by feel” – might be red flag (or vice versa). \- The coach’s athlete testimonials or references show a pattern that doesn’t align: e.g. multiple athletes saying the training was super intense and they got burned out – if you worry about intensity, that’s a red flag from other experiences.

Essentially, after an interview, you should feel the coach *heard your context* and their philosophy either naturally aligns or they are willing to tailor it. If you detect friction – e.g. they think high volume is key but you can’t do that – it’s better to find one who matches your chosen style (there are coaches who specialize in low-volume high-intensity plans and others in high-volume). Given you have specifically identified philosophies, you might even seek a coach known for that style (like a coach certified in 80/20 if that’s your pick, or someone from Trisutto if Brett’s method appealed).

Ultimately, these questions and awareness of red flags will help ensure that if the athlete does bring on a coach, it’s a complement to the plan, not a conflict, enabling the plan to be executed optimally. If any clarifications are needed or adjustments after reading this comprehensive plan, the next section will raise final questions to refine the strategy to the athlete’s unique situation.

## Clarifying Questions to Lock the Plan

Before finalizing the training plan and philosophy choice, here are **10 questions** the athlete (or coach) should answer. These will tailor the plan to personal context and ensure nothing critical is overlooked:

1. **Weekly Availability & Schedule:** “How many hours per week can you consistently train, and on which days do you have long blocks of time vs. constraints?” (Important to allocate long workouts and double sessions properly within life schedule.)

2. **Injury History:** “Do you have any past injuries (e.g. stress fractures, knee issues) or niggles currently that we need to accommodate?” (This influences intensity and run volume – e.g. if Achilles was an issue, be careful with hill sprints; if lower back, careful with aero position loads.)

3. **Strengths & Weaknesses (self-assessed):** “Which discipline do you consider your strength, and which is your weakest? And specifically, how do you feel about long climbs and hilly runs?” (Confirms if our focus on improving hill strength is correct, and maybe indicates whether to front-load training for weakness.)

4. **Terrain Access:** “What kind of terrain do you have available for training – do you have hills similar to Leeds nearby for cycling and running?” (If not, we might need to simulate hills via trainer resistance or treadmill incline for specificity.)

5. **Indoor Training Setup:** “Do you have a bike trainer and/or treadmill for training, and are you willing to use them for specific workouts?” (This affects how we schedule certain quality sessions or if weather is bad, etc. For Norwegian method, a trainer is helpful for control. For polarised, treadmill might be used for intervals safely.)

6. **Target Outcomes beyond finishing:** “Do you have a specific Ironman time goal or improvement goal (e.g. PR, age-group placing) at Leeds, or is it more about executing strongly regardless of time?” (This sets intensity of plan – if they aim to podium AG, training might be more aggressive vs just wanting a comfortable finish, where a steadier approach suffices.)

7. **TT Bike Fit Timing:** “When will you have your new TT bike and fit completed, and are there any position comfort issues now we need to solve?” (So we can schedule the adaptation period properly. If they won’t have it till 10 weeks out, plan must adjust to compress adaptation, or maybe encourage them to expedite that.)

8. **Nutritional Factors:** “Have you experienced GI or fueling issues in past races? What is your current fueling plan or products you use?” (If they have, say, a sensitive stomach, the plan should incorporate more frequent small-feed bricks to train gut, or maybe testing different nutrition in training. If they’ve never done proper carb loading, plan needs an educational piece on that before race.)

9. **Heat and Environment:** “What conditions do you train in (temperature, climate) and how will that compare to likely race day weather for Leeds?” (If they train in flat cool area but race is hilly and potentially warm, we need to include heat adaptation module and extra hill simulation. If environment is similar, then focus can remain on normal training.)

10. **Personal Stress & Recovery:** “Do you have significant non-training stress (job, family) and how many rest days or easy days do you prefer weekly to feel recovered?” (This helps calibrate plan intensity. Some may need 2 rest days a week to avoid burnout given job – we can adjust microcycle accordingly. Or if family obligations mean no training on certain day, plan around that.)

11. *(If Chris could add one more)* **Race execution experience:** “How did your last 3 Ironman races go in terms of pacing and nutrition? Any bonking or fade in run? Did you have to walk hills?” (This allows targeted improvements – e.g. if Chris always fades at mile 18 run, emphasise late-run bricks and fueling; if he struggled on bike hills, emphasize torque training and gearing knowledge.)

These questions ensure we refine the training plan to the athlete’s reality. The answers would allow adjusting training load (hours and distribution), focusing more on a weakness, confirming equipment timeline (like TT bike arrival to intensify adaptation), and addressing any gap like nutrition practice or heat acclimation in the program.

For example, if the athlete says, “I can only train 10h Mon-Fri but have weekends free up to 6h each day,” we’d cluster long workouts on weekends accordingly (maybe a big ride Sat, big brick Sun, and lighter intensity mid-week). Or if they reveal a recurring IT band issue around 15mi running, we’d perhaps cap long runs at 2h and do more frequency instead, plus prehab.

By locking down these details, the plan moves from a generic philosophy application to a personalized roadmap that the athlete can follow confidently, knowing it meshes with their life and addresses their specific race (Ironman Leeds) conditions. Each answer informs a tweak: hours distribution, specific session focus, recovery scheduling, equipment and technique emphasis, etc.

Finally, with these answered, we confirm that the chosen philosophy (or hybrid) indeed suits the athlete’s profile and will give them the best shot at a strong, controlled Ironman Leeds performance with improved bike and run and low injury risk – the overarching goal we set out.
